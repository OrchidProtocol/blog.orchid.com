We're excited to announce the release of version 0.9.23 of the Orchid app. This update brings a number of important improvements, including new languages and updated documentation. These upgrades are designed to help bring Orchid's unique decentralized VPN marketplace to more people around the world who need a reliable, easy-to-use privacy solution.

The most noticeable change included in version 0.9.23 is the addition of three new languages. Orchid is now available in Italian, Portuguese, and Spanish, which have a combined 750 million speakers in dozens of countries. With the need for strong Internet privacy [growing in many regions](/how-people-are-reclaiming-internet-freedom-from-dubai-to-ukraine-to-venezuela/) of the world, this update makes Orchid accessible to more people than ever before.

Version 0.9.23 also includes updated and improved translations in Russian, Mandarin, Japanese, Korean and Indonesian. In total, Orchid is now available in nine languages. Additional changes include a Flutter update that fixes a known bug in the macOS app, which had resulted in clicks not being registered in the app's UI. Finally, to better detail how to create and use Orchid accounts, we have updated documentation for the Orchid ecosystem at [docs.orchid.com](https://docs.orchid.com/).

Orchid is able to offer its privacy solution across many diverse languages thanks to the continued contributions and talent of our community. A big thank-you goes out to supporters who helped our team in accurately translating the details of the Orchid app's decentralized VPN solution. Our goal is to restore the Internet as a place of freedom and exploration for everyone around the world, and speaking to people in their own language is a crucial step in achieving that vision.
