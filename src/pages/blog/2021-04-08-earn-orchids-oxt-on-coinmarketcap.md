In addition to logging IP addresses, most websites -- [though not all](https://blog.orchid.com/how-we-built-orchidcom-without-cookies-or-other-tracking-tools/) -- also track users with cookies. Cookies are often used to predict the behavior of an Internet user based on their past actions. They are the reason [we see ads](https://blog.orchid.com/data-creep/) in our social media news feeds for items we recently searched for on another website. As cookies accumulate, they [produce a detailed digital identit](https://blog.orchid.com/tracking-pixels-explained/)y for each of us, and this identity follows us wherever we go online.

Fortunately, like deleting browser histories, clearing cookies is relatively straightforward. It's a simple command that can be reached through most browsers' drop-down menus. But be sure to clear your cookies on every browser and every device you use -- actions taken in Chrome, for example, won't have any effect in Safari.

It's also important to remember that clearing your cookies doesn't protect you going forward -- while it gives you a clean slate, cookies will start accumulating again as soon as you resume online activity. It's best to clear cookies often -- but for the strongest online privacy, additional steps are needed.

The safest option is to use an Internet privacy solution

For the strongest online privacy, the best approach is to use an Internet privacy tool. VPNs are a good place to start, as is Tor. The latter, in particular, is one of the best ways to avoid the type of "fingerprinting" that occurs when cookies accumulate. Orchid combines the strength of leading VPNs with innovative, [blockchain-based technology](https://medium.com/orchid-labs/probabilistic-nanopayments-4aa423c3f22f) to offer strong anonymity to its users. With Orchid, people can string together multiple "[hops](https://blog.orchid.com/what-is-a-hop/)" between providers, providing a "failsafe" mechanism that can maintain privacy even if a given VPN logs data, [leaks](https://blog.orchid.com/how-to-make-sure-your-vpn-is-working-properly/), or is hacked. Orchid is pay-as-you-go, with no monthly commitment. And it's easy to use: getting started [takes only seconds](https://blog.orchid.com/how-to-start-using-orchids-crypto-vpn-in-seconds/). With Orchid, it's possible to reclaim the Internet as a place of freedom and exploration.
