The Orchid team will be at ETHDenver, will you?

Don't miss talks from Orchid CEO Dr. Steven Waterhouse (Seven) and Head of Technology Jay Freeman. Jay will also be a mentor and a hackathon judge.

On **Friday, February 18**, there will be two presentations from the Orchid team.

### ATTACKING AN ETHEREUM L2 WITH UNBRIDLED OPTIMISM

At 9:40 AM on the Infinity Stage in the Sports Castle, Jay Freeman will give the backstory of how he came to discover one of the more devastating bugs so far seen in a "layer 2" solution: the ability to replicate an unbounded amount of money on Optimism.

Attendees can expect to leave this talk knowing a bit more about corner cases in the EVM, how Geth maintains its account state trie, and the history of Optimism's OVM. A devastatingly simple exploit that could mint exponential OETH for linear gas will be examined in detail as part of a tutorial using a simple technique to locally test exploits without a devnet.

You can read more about the bug and its discovery in Jay's article, *["Attacking an Ethereum L2 with Unbridled Optimism."](https://www.saurik.com/optimism.html)*

Note this talk is currently listed on the ETHDenver schedule as "Attack on L2: Unbounded Money."

### THE CRYPTOPUNK ETHOS AND THE FUTURE OF FREEDOM

At 12:20 PM on the Laser Stage in the Sports Castle, Dr. Steven Waterhouse (Seven) will explain how the punks are trying to save us from a world where government-issued digital currency restricts what we can buy or how much of it we can purchase. That's the future we will get unless we do something about it now - and the punks are rising to the challenge.

The team can't wait to see you all there!
