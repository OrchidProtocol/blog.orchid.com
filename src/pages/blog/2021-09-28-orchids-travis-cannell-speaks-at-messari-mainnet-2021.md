Orchid's Head of Product, Travis Cannell, was a featured speaker at [Messari Mainnet](https://mainnet.events/), a premier event in the blockchain space. Travis led a workshop on the Orchid app and its [user-friendly onboarding process](https://www.orchid.com/join/#:~:text=Connect%20your%20account%20and%20app,ready%20to%20start%20exploring%20freely.) on the third day of the event, which took place from September 20th to 22nd in New York City.

Travis began by highlighting Orchid's unique design, especially compared to other decentralized applications (dApps). In particular, he showed how Orchid's [in-app payment system](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sm0oVYyNh10) lets anyone use an ordinary credit card to fund their account in less than a minute for as little as $1. Travis also demonstrated how the in-app payments feature allows users to fund their Orchid accounts without the need to buy OXT, Orchid's digital asset.

People who [use OXT to pay for VPN bandwidth](https://blog.orchid.com/how-to-start-using-orchid-with-oxt/), however, can still easily do so by locating their Funder Account address in the app. Travis also showed how the service creates an [Orchid Identity](https://docs.orchid.com/en/latest/accounts/#the-orchid-address-key), or [signer key](https://docs.orchid.com/en/latest/accounts/#the-orchid-address-key), for each user, which allows them to manage their OXT wallets within the app.

After speaking about Orchid's onboarding process, Travis gave a ten-minute demonstration on how the dApp works. The presentation covered how to [purchase bandwidth](https://blog.orchid.com/how-much-does-bandwidth-cost-on-orchid/), how to [activate the VPN](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpEtlUQV1vw) and [check that it's working properly](https://blog.orchid.com/how-to-make-sure-your-vpn-is-working-properly/), and how to [configure VPN settings ](https://docs.orchid.com/en/v0.9.8/using-orchid/)in the app.
