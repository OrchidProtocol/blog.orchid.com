The Internet is currently undergoing a period of rapid change. Increasing adoption of blockchain technology, growing public awareness about personal privacy, and [serious questions](https://time.com/6146178/meta-facebook-eu-withdraw-data/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CWe%20have%20absolutely%20no%20desire,said%20in%20an%20emailed%20statement.) about the future of platforms like Facebook have sparked a movement away from centralized control and toward decentralized technology.

All of this has caused quite a bit of buzz about the promise of Web 3.0, a [decentralized Internet](https://blog.orchid.com/the-revolution-will-be-decentralized-privacy-in-the-dweb/) in which people maintain control of their own identities and data online. While there's still much progress to be made, increased adoption of blockchain technology and other decentralized tools have started to turn Web 3.0 from a vision into a reality.

The terms Web 1.0, Web 2.0, and Web 3.0 do not describe specific technologies, moments in time, or networks. They identify what are viewed as the fundamental epochs in the development of the Internet since its inception several decades ago, based on technological advancements, widespread adoption, patterns of use, and other factors.  This article will explore how the culture of online privacy has changed over the last few decades.

### Web 0: The ARPANET and Other Early Networks

The very earliest days of the Internet are sometimes referred to as Web 0. This term describes the 1960s era when the ARPANET—the Advanced Research Projects Agency Network—was invented as a way for government researchers to share information with one another.

Before the ARPANET, sharing data meant storing it on magnetic computer tapes that had to be carried from one computer to another. Computers were so heavy and immobile that there was no easy way to bring them into the same location. For example, UNIVAC I (Universal Automatic Computer I)—used by the U.S. Census Bureau in the 1950s and 60s—weighed [16,000 pounds](https://www.usg.edu/galileo/skills/unit07/internet07_02.phtml) (nearly 8,000 kilograms).

While ARPANET was a revolutionary advance, its capacity was restricted. The government would only allow certain academic and research organizations who had contracts with the Defense Department to use it. Later, the Department created a second network called the Defense Data Network.

Restricting who could and could not access the ARPANET and the Defense Data Network was the earliest form of Internet privacy. Limiting access to the ARPANET was a move aimed at human dangers, not digital ones; the idea was to prevent foreign spies from accessing the networks. And while the first self-replicating computer virus was [created in the 1970s](https://www.kaspersky.com/resource-center/threats/a-brief-history-of-computer-viruses-and-what-the-future-holds#:~:text=As%20noted%20by%20Discovery%2C%20the,self%2Dreplicating%20program%20was%20possible.), it would be many years before such non-human threats became a widespread problem.

The ARPANET formed the basis for what we know as the Internet today. But before the concept was able to scale across the globe, researchers had to fill a critical gap: standardization.

Many consider the birthday of the Internet to be January 1st, 1983. The reason is that prior to this day, the ARPANET, along with various other remote computer networks that had emerged, did not have a standard way to communicate with one another.

But on that fateful day in 1983, Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) researchers Vint Cerf and Bob Kahn [deployed](https://www.internetsociety.org/blog/2016/09/final-report-on-tcpip-migration-in-1983/) a suite of new network protocols called [Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP)](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/glossary/tcp-ip/). TCP/IP was quickly adopted as the default method of data communication on the Internet. It acted as a tool for standardizing communications between computers and networks, all of which could now be connected by a universal language.

### Web 1.0: The Beginnings of the Internet as we Know it Today

Just a few years later in 1990, the so-called "World Wide Web" was introduced to the public by Sir Tim Berners-Lee.

This was the beginning of the era described today as Web 1.0, or the "read-only web." Web pages at this stage of the Internet were created using static programming languages like [Server Side Includes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_Side_Includes) or [Common Gateway Interface (CGI)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Gateway_Interface). Practically speaking, the web's "read-only" framework meant that sites contained mostly text and hyperlinks with limited interactive elements. While some more advanced sites had CSS and JavaScript animation effects, almost all activity was one-way. Users were mostly passive, and much human input and feedback still took place offline.

### Privacy in Web 1.0

Ideas about Internet privacy in Web 1.0 were radically different from today's landscape. For example, running advertisements in Web 1.0 was [forbidden](https://www.techopedia.com/definition/27960/web-10). But after several years, companies began to look to the Internet as a new commercial frontier. At the time, commercial websites had limited ways of knowing what their users were interested in.

While shopkeepers in brick-and-mortar stores could observe the kinds of customers that walked through their doors, and take note of the items that interested them, commercial websites had no viable way of obtaining this information. So, in 1994, while working for a brand new company called Netscape, Internet pioneer [Lou Montulli](https://www.cato.org/commentary/how-cookie-gate-crumbles#:~:text=Cookies%20were%20invented%20by%20Internet,sites%20become%20viable%20commercial%20enterprises.) invented [cookies](https://www.ftc.gov/site-information/privacy-policy/internet-cookies): small pieces of information saved by your web browser that websites can use to observe your online behavior and recognize your device in the future.

Soon, ads went from banned to ubiquitous. The invention of the "pop-up" caused endless consternation for early Internet users, and the proliferation of online advertising that followed ushered in a new era of data collection, both by individuals and corporations.

Some of the earliest forms of personal data collection happened through spyware. The term was first introduced in October 1995, when it appeared on a distributed Internet discussion system known as Usenet in an article about Microsoft. But most people encountered Internet spyware for the first time in 1999, when a [rumor](https://tedium.co/2017/12/21/elf-bowling-history/) spread that it was contained in the .exe file of a popular game called Elf Bowling.

1999 was also the year when people started to make connections between spyware and advertising on the Internet. [Steve Gibson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Gibson_(computer_programmer)), founder of computer software development firm Gibson Research Corporation, [found advertising software](https://support.adaware.com/hc/en-us/articles/360046760131-THE-HISTORY-OF-SPYWARE) on his computer and came to suspect that it was stealing his personal information.

This software—which later became known as adware—had been installed without Gibson's knowledge, and was designed to be difficult to remove. Being a computer scientist himself, Gibson decided to develop software that could counter-attack the program that was stealing his data. This led to the development of OptOut, widely known as the first-ever anti-spyware application.

### The Advent of Web 2.0

Over time, developments in technology allowed web pages to become more interactive—ultimately leading to a new paradigm now widely known as Web 2.0. Whereas Web 1.0 was the "read-only" Internet, Web 2.0 is often referred to as the "read-write" Internet. Instead of just reading information, Internet users gained the ability to comment and add their own content. People could suddenly use a huge range of web-based applications—all without changing any technical specifications. Podcasting, video-sharing sites, social media, searching and indexing sites, and service-based web applications are all a part of Web 2.0.

For instance, social media sites allow their users to interact and collaborate with each other as creators of user-generated content in virtual communities. While virtual communities, such as message boards, had existed almost since the dawn of the Internet, people had previously needed to create their own websites if they wanted to upload significant content to the web.

### Privacy in Web 2.0

In Web 1.0, then, having an online presence meant having your own website. But the advent of social media, commercial directory sites, and contract-based service apps like Uber and UpWork enabled people to make themselves known online without building a website of their own. Instead, apps provided users with platforms to build online identities, and to connect with friends, service providers, and potential customers. No need to make an independent site, just make a Facebook page; don't start your own Taxi company—drive Uber instead, these platforms seemed to suggest.

And that's exactly what people did. After all, there are a number of tangible benefits that these third-party sites offer: they can make users more easily searchable, and endless feeds ensure that content-consumers are more likely to see the text, images, and videos that you're sharing. 

Many of these services—including Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram—offer their platforms for free. And while it won't cost you any money to make a profile on most social networks, there are hidden costs involved.

### The Dark Side of Web 2.0

Web 2.0 platforms have benefited greatly from the network effect: the phenomenon in which a product or service becomes more valuable as more people participate. In other words, as more people use a site like Facebook or Twitter, the more useful it becomes. As a result, a small number of these platforms have gradually monopolized much of the activity on the Internet. And the larger they become, the more control they have over what users can see, do, and participate in.

This growing centralization of control in the hands of a few actors brings major risks to personal privacy. Because large centralized platforms are the basis for so much activity and information on the Internet, many people don't have the choice not to use them. And once a user signs up for an account, platforms have a high level of insight into their online behavior. Insight on such a vast scope has opened the door to large-scale data mining: Google, Facebook, and others track, analyze, and monetize what their users do online. The data that is collected by these platforms is stored in centralized servers, where it can be (and [has been](https://www.businessinsider.com/stolen-data-of-533-million-facebook-users-leaked-online-2021-4)) compromised.

Web 2.0's privacy problems are much more existential than those that existed in Web 1.0. Things like spyware and adware still exist, certainly—but the greater threat is the fact that people have to sign away their privacy in order to access large portions of the Internet.

### Web 3.0: A Private and Secure Internet

The advent of the next phase of the Internet—known as Web 3.0—aims to solve many of the problems of Web 2.0 by fundamentally reshaping the infrastructure of the Internet.

Also known as the [decentralized web](https://blog.orchid.com/the-revolution-will-be-decentralized-privacy-in-the-dweb/), Web 3.0 promises to deliver users all of the interactive experiences that Web 2.0 has to offer today—and more. But instead of requiring people to give up control over their personal data, Web 3.0 will provide the infrastructure for them to maintain complete ownership of their identities and behaviors on the Internet.

In other words, applications similar to the social media and commercial services that we use each day would still be available. But instead of being owned and controlled by centralized companies, these systems would be autonomously run by a series of open-source, smart contract-based protocols. In this landscape, no single entity could ever control the means to publish and access information, interact with digital communities, or make purchases online.

In a fully-developed Web 3.0, users would also maintain full [control over their data](https://www.orchid.com/how-it-works/). People would have the ability to act anonymously, or to verify identities online without disclosing any of their personal information to centralized entities. For example, smart contracts could autonomously authenticate identity data stored in a token or wallet address without exposing it to a third party.

Web 3.0 has not yet been fully realized. However, there are a growing number of technologies that are shifting today's online environment towards full decentralization. And if this trend continues, people will soon have the ability to access information and connect with one another in new and innovative ways, while maintaining their inalienable rights to privacy and freedom in the digital realm.
