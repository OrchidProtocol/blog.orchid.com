We are thrilled to announce that Professor **Rohan Grey** of Willamette University will speak at Orchid's [Priv8 Virtual Privacy Summit](https://www.orchid.com/priv8/). Priv8, a first-of-its-kind event focused on digital privacy, is a venue for experts to share their experiences, predictions, hopes, and advice with like-minded people around the world. Professor Grey joins a growing slate of distinguished speakers, including whistleblower and cybersecurity expert **Edward Snowden**,  Electronic Frontier Foundation Executive Director **Cindy Cohn**, Digital Minister of Taiwan **Audrey Tang**, and Executive and Director at the Linux Foundation **Brian Behlendorf**.

At Willamette, Professor Grey studies the legal design and regulation of money and finance, including digital fiat currency. At Priv8, he will participate in a panel entitled "After cash: keeping secrets in permissionless finance."

Professor Grey will be joined by experts from many different spheres related to privacy. In a time when Covid-19 has pushed [so much of life](/tips-for-protecting-your-privacy-while-working-from-home/) online, and governments have enacted a variety of [unprecedented emergency measures](/defending-freedom-in-the-time-of-coronavirus/), privacy has surged to the forefront of public debate. In the midst of escalating danger from governments and corporations, robust discussion and education around the topic are more important than ever.

Priv8 will take place over three days, from **March 23-25**. A full schedule of events, as well as additional details about Priv8, will be made public. Register [here](https://www.orchid.com/priv8) to attend, free of charge.
