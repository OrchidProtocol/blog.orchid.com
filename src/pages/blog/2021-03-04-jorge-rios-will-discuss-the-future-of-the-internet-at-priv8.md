We are thrilled to announce that Jorge Rios of Bridgefy will speak at Orchid's [Priv8 Virtual Privacy Summit](https://www.orchid.com/priv8/). Priv8, a first-of-its-kind event focused on digital privacy, is a venue for experts advocates to share their experiences, predictions, hopes, and advice with like-minded people around the world. Jorge joins a growing slate of distinguished speakers, including whistleblower and cybersecurity expert Edward Snowden,  Electronic Frontier Foundation Executive Director Cindy Cohn, Digital Minister of Taiwan Audrey Tang, Executive and Director at the Linux Foundation Brian Behlendorf.

At Priv8, Jorge will take part in a panel discussion on the future of the Internet. The participants will discuss the vulnerability of today's web to state and corporate domination, and explore ways to preserve and strengthen openness and connectivity in a world increasingly at risk of digital fragmentation.

Jorge will be joined by experts from many different spheres related to privacy. In a time when Covid-19 has pushed [so much of life](/tips-for-protecting-your-privacy-while-working-from-home/) online and governments have enacted a variety of [unprecedented emergency measures](/defending-freedom-in-the-time-of-coronavirus/), privacy has surged to the forefront of public debate. In the midst of escalating danger from governments and corporations, robust discussion and education around the topic are more important than ever.

Priv8 will take place over three days, from March 23-25. A full schedule of events, as well as additional details about Priv8, will be made public over the coming weeks. You can register [here](https://www.orchid.com/priv8) to attend.
