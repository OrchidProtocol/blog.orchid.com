OXT, the Orchid digital asset, is now listed on [Indodax](https://indodax.com/), as Orchid continues its global expansion, entering new markets particularly in Asia.

One of the largest crypto exchanges in Indonesia and Southeast Asia, on Indodax users can trade the local rupiah currency for Bitcoin and other assets, such as Ethereum and Litecoin, and now OXT. Indodax has about 2.3 million users and is the largest digital asset exchange in Indonesia, the world's fourth largest country by population.

New users can open an Orchid account by purchasing at least $4 in OXT and $1 of ETH on Indodax. Once the account is created, a shareable QR code will appear that contains account credentials. Anyone can copy or scan that account into the app for a simple, one-step setup.

Orchid's unique VPN marketplace uses a robust system of incentives to match supply with demand and ensure ample bandwidth is available. People use OXT to fund their account, and can then purchase VPN service on a pay-as-you-go basis.

> Dr. Steven Waterhouse, Orchid's Co-Founder and CEO, is thrilled that people in Indonesia can now use Indodax to get OXT and explore the Internet more freely. "The inclusion of OXT on Indodax marks an important step for Orchid's expansion into the global market," he said.
