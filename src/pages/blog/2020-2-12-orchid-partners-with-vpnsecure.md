As Orchid continues to build tools for a private and fair internet, we’ll be collaborating with other leaders in electronic privacy. Today, we’re proud to announce Orchid’s integration with VPNSecure, a premiere digital security firm.

Since 2010, VPNSecure has provided security-conscious users a powerful tool for safe browsing. Users know that VPNSecure never logs its users’ IP addresses, connection or disconnection timestamps, bandwidth usages, DNS request.

Users can pay for private bandwidth from VPNSecure on a per-byte basis using Orchid’s native currency, OXT, available on [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/price/orchid). Existing VPNSecure subscribers can use their OpenVPN credentials in the Orchid app, and even combine them with other privacy providers to construct multi-hop routes. 

Shayne McCulloch, Founder of VPNSecure, said: “VPNSecure is proud to partner with Orchid to provide privacy anywhere, anytime. We share Orchid’s vision of an open and free internet and this brings us even closer, as we are able to give control back to internet users. This was a natural partnership — we both remain committed to protecting users’ data privacy.”

Dr. Steven Waterhouse, Orchid’s Co-Founder and CEO said: “At Orchid, we’re always happy to partner with like-minded firms and individuals, and for years we’ve admired the work that VPNSecure has done in the privacy and security space. We’re honored and excited to work with them to build a better internet.”
