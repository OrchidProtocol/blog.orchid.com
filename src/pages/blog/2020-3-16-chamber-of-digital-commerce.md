Beyond making the internet open and accessible to everyone, at Orchid we’ve always promoted the adoption of blockchain tech for innovation and social good —  that’s why all of our technology is open source. Today, we’re proud to announce that we’ve joined the Chamber of Digital Commerce, an organization leading the push toward a better public understanding and embrace of blockchain technology. 

Orchid co-founder and CEO Dr. Steven Waterhouse (Seven) said: “Restoring the internet to the free and open frontier it once was requires not only advancement in technology, but in policy as well. We’re thrilled to work with some of the most forward-thinking minds in tech policy to make the decentralized web a reality.” 

Perianne Boring, Founder and President of the Chamber of Digital Commerce said: “We established the Chamber of Digital Commerce to advocate for the constructive and inventive use of blockchain and related digital assets. Orchid’s innovative technology, extensive partnerships, and commitment to privacy make it a leader in the blockchain world. We’re proud to collaborate with them.” 

As a blockchain-powered platform, Orchid has a responsibility to promote the acceptance, growth, and understanding of distributed ledger technology. After much consideration, our team decided that joining the Chamber of Digital Commerce was one of the best ways to achieve this goal.

The Chamber of Digital Commerce is the largest trade association for blockchain, with over 200  partners and members, including many of the world’s largest financial services and blockchain firms.
