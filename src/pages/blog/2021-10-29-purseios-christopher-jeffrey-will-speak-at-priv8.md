We are thrilled to announce that **Christopher Jeffrey** of Purse.io will speak at [Priv8 Virtual Privacy Summit](https://www.orchid.com/priv8/), presented by Orchid and Handshake. Priv8, a unique event focused on digital privacy, is a venue for experts to share their experiences, predictions, hopes, and advice with like-minded people around the world. Christopher joins a growing slate of distinguished speakers, including journalist, analyst, and author **Glenn Greenwald**.

Christopher is the chief technology officer at Purse.io, a company that provides Amazon shoppers with discounts by matching them with individuals who wish to exchange gift cards for Bitcoin. He is most well-known for being one of only eight developers ever to reimplement the Bitcoin Core codebase from scratch. He is the creator of an alternative Bitcoin full node in nodeJS called bcoin. Christopher is also the lead developer and architect of the Handshake naming system, and has a prolific background in FOSS development that spans more than ten years. Several of his libraries have been used by the likes of Microsoft and Oracle. He is one of a handful of protocol developers with deep expertise in authenticated data structures and cryptography, and has co-authored a research paper with Dan Boneh on a privacy-preserving signature scheme called GooSig.

Christopher has previously held roles at organizations across the tech space including GoDaddy, BitPay, and NodeJitsu. Christopher is also a self-described "Menace to Crypto; Destroyer of RAM; Hater of Centralization; and Keeper of the Cryptowalk."

He will be joined by experts from many different spheres related to privacy. In a time when governments are testing the limits of individual privacy [in the name of public safety](https://www.reddit.com/r/orchid/comments/mo6ai4/priv8_kara_swisher_speaks_with_audrey_tang_on_how/), and powerful technology companies hold greater sway over public policy [than ever before](https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-big-tech-got-even-bigger-11612587632), privacy has surged to the forefront of public debate. As such, robust discussion and education around the topic are more important than ever.

Priv8 will take place virtually on **November 15th**. A full schedule of speakers, as well as additional details about Priv8, will be made public ahead of the event. Register [here](https://www.orchid.com/priv8) to attend, free of charge.
