We are thrilled to announce that technology journalist **Benjamin Powers** will speak at Orchid's [Priv8 Virtual Privacy Summit](https://www.orchid.com/priv8/). Priv8, a first-of-its-kind event focused on digital privacy, is a venue for experts to share their experiences, predictions, hopes, and advice with like-minded people around the world. Benjamin joins a growing slate of distinguished speakers, including journalist, analyst, and author **Glenn Greenwald**.

Benjamin is known for his coverage of artificial intelligence, privacy, and big data. His bylines include the Wall Street Journal, Rolling Stone,  New Republic, Pacific Standard, CityLab, BREAKER Mag, Smithsonian, Playboy,  Paste Magazine, and Coindesk, where he served as the resident Privacy Reporter.

Benjamin will be joined by experts from many different spheres related to privacy. In a time when governments are testing the limits of individual privacy [in the name of public safety](https://www.reddit.com/r/orchid/comments/mo6ai4/priv8_kara_swisher_speaks_with_audrey_tang_on_how/), and powerful technology companies hold greater sway over public policy [than ever before](https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-big-tech-got-even-bigger-11612587632), privacy has surged to the forefront of public debate. As such, robust discussion and education around the topic are more important than ever.

Priv8 will take place virtually on **November 15th**. A full schedule of events, as well as additional details about Priv8, will be made public ahead of the event. Register [here](https://www.orchid.com/priv8) to attend, free of charge.
