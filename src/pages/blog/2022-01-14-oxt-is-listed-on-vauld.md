OXT is vital to Orchid's mission of protecting online privacy. VPN service providers compete for user payments by staking OXT, ensuring that ample bandwidth is always available to end-users. Anyone can start using Orchid in seconds by [purchasing pre-filled OXT accounts](https://blog.orchid.com/why-orchids-in-app-purchases-are-a-game-changer-for-dapp-usage/) for as little as $1 with just an ordinary credit card. And thanks to Orchid's novel system of [probabilistic nanopayments](https://medium.com/orchid-labs/probabilistic-nanopayments-4aa423c3f22f), they only pay for the bandwidth they use.

**Dr. Steven Waterhouse, Orchid's Co-Founder and CEO**, said: "OXT is at the core of Orchid's privacy solution. Listing OXT on a reputable platform like Vauld helps Orchid accomplish its goal of making online privacy accessible to everyone."
