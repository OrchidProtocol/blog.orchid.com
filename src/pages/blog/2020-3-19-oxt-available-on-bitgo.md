We’re thrilled to announce that Orchid is partnering with BitGo, a leading digital asset financial services platform. Our supporters can now store and secure their OXT in BitGo’s security-first, multi-signature wallets through their unified API platform.

Dr. Steven Waterhouse, Orchid’s Co-Founder and CEO said: “Orchid is proud to have the support of some of the most important institutions in tech. Our goal is to make the internet a safer, more free place. BitGo provides that same sense of security to our institutional partners, in a streamlined experience.”

Orchid is a unique VPN because it requires OXT to fund an account. VPN service in the app is purchased with OXT from the connected account, and you pay only for the bandwidth that you actually use.
