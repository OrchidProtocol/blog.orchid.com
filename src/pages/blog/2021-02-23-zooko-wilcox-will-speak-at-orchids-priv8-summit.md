We are thrilled to announce that **Zooko Wilcox**, Founder and CEO of the Electric Coin Company that leads the development of Zcash, will speak at Orchid's [Priv8 Virtual Privacy Summit](https://www.orchid.com/priv8/). Priv8, a first-of-its-kind event focused on digital privacy, is a venue for experts advocates to share their experiences, predictions, hopes, and advice with like-minded people around the world. Zooko joins a growing slate of distinguished speakers, including whistleblower and cybersecurity expert **Edward Snowden**, Electronic Frontier Foundation Executive Director **Cindy Cohn**, Digital Minister of Taiwan **Audrey Tang**, Executive and Director at the Linux Foundation **Brian Behlendorf**.

Zooko is a computer security specialist, cypherpunk, and part of a founding team that launched Zcash in 2016. At Priv8, he will share his thoughts on how better to think about ideas of financial privacy.

Zooko will give a talk at Priv8 titled, "A better way to think about financial privacy." which will be followed by questions from the audience. He will also expand on his thoughts on financial privacy in an essay for Priv8 Eye, a limited-run newsletter that will be published over the duration of the conference.

Zooko will be joined at Priv8 by experts from many different spheres related to privacy. In a time when Covid-19 has pushed [so much of life](/tips-for-protecting-your-privacy-while-working-from-home/) online and governments have enacted a variety of [unprecedented emergency measures](/defending-freedom-in-the-time-of-coronavirus/), privacy has surged to the forefront of public debate. In the midst of escalating danger from governments and corporations, robust discussion and education around the topic are more important than ever.

Priv8 will take place over three days, from **March 23-25**. A full schedule of events, as well as additional details about Priv8, will be made public over the coming weeks. You can register [here](https://www.orchid.com/priv8) to attend.
