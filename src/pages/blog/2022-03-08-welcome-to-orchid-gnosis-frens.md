Orchid's dapp now supports the Gnosis chain! We invite the community to try making an account on the Gnosis chain and funding with xDAI, connecting it to Orchid's VPN app and seeing how Orchid's L2 nanopayment system works when paying $0.06/GB for VPN service.

After connecting a wallet on the Gnosis chain, users can specify an Orchid identity to fund using $xDAI. Gnosis' low network fees mean that moving funds in and out of each account only costs a few pennies. The initial deposit requirement to start using Orchid is also lower on Gnosis—currently,  the total suggested balance and deposit is about 0.01 xDAI! Refer to our [chart](https://www.orchid.com/join) to see how the cost of using Orchid on Gnosis compares to other blockchains.

### Why Gnosis?

The Gnosis chain has exceptionally low fees and is therefore a great chain for learning how Orchid accounts work. Another benefit is that $xDAI is a stable coin, so your funds aren't vulnerable to the typical volatility of crypto markets.

Gas fees on Ethereum have been rising. Given the heightened amount of activity on the network, they are likely to continue to do so. Many Layer 2 solutions—including Orchid's probabilistic nanopayments—have emerged as remedies to this problem, as well as the development of separate, EVM-compatible blockchains capable of running dApps that were originally designed for Ethereum itself.

Orchid has adopted a [multichain strategy](https://blog.orchid.com/orchid-nanopayments-now-streaming-on-8-blockchains/) to make its decentralized VPN marketplace affordable and accessible to all.

"We have used xDAI on the Gnosis chain for over a year in our VPN app for those who want to buy VPN credits. This expands our work so users can bring their own xDAI to make accounts  in our dapp and we are excited about the synergy between Gnosis and Orchid's "probabilistic rollup" layer 2." said Travis Cannell, Orchid's head of product.

### How to Use the Orchid VPN on Gnosis

The basic steps to use Orchid on Gnosis are detailed [here](https://orchid.com/join). In short:

-   Connect your wallet to the Gnosis chain and get enough xDAI in that wallet for the balance + deposit + funding fee

-   Download the Orchid app, add your funding wallet and then select and copy the Orchid identity you want to fund

-   Open the dapp at account.orchid.com

-   Connect your funding wallet and paste in the Orchid identity

-   Add funds! The app will then have a connected, funded account

### About Probabilistic Nanopayments, Orchid's Unique Layer 2 Solution

Orchid's unique system of [probabilistic nanopayments](https://medium.com/orchid-labs/probabilistic-nanopayments-4aa423c3f22f) is an Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)-compatible Layer 2 solution that enables tiny amounts of money to be sent as off-chain probabilities. The technology is emerging as a new form of rollup, differentiated from zero-knowledge rollups or more traditional rollups. A "probabilistic rollup" allows for many off-chain transactions to be sent that eventually settle using probability. When users buy VPN bandwidth on Orchid, transactions are sent as nanopayments, each of which is worth approximately one one-thousandth (1/1,000) of a penny, depending upon how the account is configured. Probabilistic nanopayments allow Orchid users access to a unique pay-as-you-go model for VPN service. Orchid never charges fixed fees or monthly subscriptions (as many centralized VPNs do), making its bandwidth market truly trustless and decentralized.

Privacy is Orchid's mission. Probabilistic nanopayments, along with this integration with Gnosis chain, are two critical components of Orchid's goal of making online privacy accessible to people everywhere—restoring the Internet as a place of freedom and exploration in the process.
