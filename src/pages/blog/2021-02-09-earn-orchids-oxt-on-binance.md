We are thrilled to announce that the community will soon be able to earn the Orchid digital asset, OXT, through Binance's "[Learn and Earn](https://support.binance.us/hc/en-us/sections/360009349034-Learn-and-Earn)" campaign. Binance, one of the world's largest digital asset exchanges, will reward users with OXT for studying videos and completing quizzes about Orchid and its incentivized VPN marketplace. 

[Binance](http://binance.com), which will publish the campaign's rules and duration, incentivizes people to understand the companies behind the cryptoassets on its exchange by testing their knowledge with simple and fun quizzes. The program is the latest earn-style campaign after similar programs on Coinbase and CoinMarketCap. 

> "Binance is known the world over for its premier services in the digital asset space," said Orchid CEO Dr. Steven Waterhouse. "We are excited to enable more people to join our digital privacy marketplace through this latest earn campaign."

Orchid's unique VPN marketplace uses a robust system of incentives to match supply with demand and ensure ample bandwidth is available. Accounts are funded with OXT, which is then used to purchase VPN service on a pay-as-you-go basis. But while Orchid's digital currency is key to the functioning of the marketplace, individual users can start using Orchid in seconds using nothing more than an ordinary credit card. This innovation effectively masks the blockchain, giving users the benefits of decentralization while providing a seamless user experience.

Binance is one of the world's leading blockchain and cryptocurrency infrastructure providers with a financial product suite that includes the largest digital asset exchange by volume. Trusted by millions worldwide, the Binance platform is dedicated to increasing the freedom of money for users, and features diverse crypto products and offerings, including: trading and finance, education, data and research, social good, investment and incubation, decentralization and infrastructure solutions, and more.
