The cloud computing industry is faced with a conundrum.

"There is this enormous amount of demand for [cloud] computing," Greg Osuri, Founder and CEO of Akash Network, told Derek Silva, host of the Priv8 podcast. "There is also an enormous supply; still, the two do not meet up."

> "I don't see a reason why this supply should not meet demand, and I don't see a reason why we have a middle man taking advantage of this...right now, 81 percent of the market share is controlled by 4 companies," Greg said.

The Akash Network describes itself as the world's first open-source, decentralized cloud network. Through the principles of decentralization and open-source, the organization is attempting to address this issue--and to make cloud computing more accessible.

**What is the "deployment problem"?**

Greg said that his interest in cloud computing began when he repeatedly observed developers dealing with a "deployment problem."

> "When developers create their applications, the next step is to take the applications and make them available to users," he said. As part of this process, "they have to move their workloads to a dedicated computer or data center."

"That process--especially when you do it in a collaborative way--seemed to be the biggest source of friction" for app developers, Greg explained.

Cloud-based data storage and computing seemed to be the answer. However, centralized service providers offered solutions that were costly and vulnerable to attacks by hackers.

"We needed to give sovereignty back to developers. Cloud-based technology was getting bigger and bigger, and the tool chain was getting increasingly misaligned." In other words, the divide between what developers wanted and what they were getting was growing.

**Centralized cloud computing services waste approximately 85 percent of capacity**

"At the same time, we found out that 85% of the capacity of [centralized] data centers remains unused," Greg continued. "The reason for that is that you need to plan for peak usage." However, "most of the time, you're not at peak," which means that many of the resources that these data centers provide go unused.

> "That's when the idea of creating a marketplace came about. When we created this marketplace, we wanted to make sure that it was open-source and that it would remain open-source, both in terms of access and source code...We also wanted a cloud deployment system that has immediate consistency."

Perhaps most importantly, "We wanted a self-sustaining ecosystem where even without us, the system could function by itself."

"When we put these things together, we ended up with crypto," Greg said. Thus, Akash was born.

**How does decentralized cloud computing benefit businesses and people?**

Derek asked Greg how decentralized cloud services can help individuals and companies, particularly those with a lack of financial resources.

> "As you know, Greg said, "the needs of developers are getting bigger and more complex," and, correspondingly, "the need for data processing is doubling every two years."

> "I grew up in India on a farm, so for me, getting access to a computer was very difficult--I didn't own a computer until I was in college. But I did learn how to code when I was 8, mostly through books. Information was very hard to come by."

Just like his younger self, Greg noted that today, "There are millions of kids without access to computing."
