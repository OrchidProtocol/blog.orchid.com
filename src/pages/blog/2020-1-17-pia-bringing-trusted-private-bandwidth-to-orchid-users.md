In order to build a strong and secure privacy network, it’s important to start with a foundation of high-quality bandwidth providers. That’s why we’re thrilled to welcome [Private Internet Access](https://www.privateinternetaccess.com/) (PIA) as one of our key partners to protect online privacy and freedom on the Internet.

We value PIA's commitment to maintaining the [highest standards of privacy](https://www.pcmag.com/picks/the-best-vpn-services), while simultaneously providing one of the most reliable VPN services in the world with plenty of endpoint countries and no logs of your connection or activity.  

Users can pay for private bandwidth from PIA on a per-byte basis using Orchid’s native currency, OXT, available on [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/price/orchid). Existing PIA subscribers can use their OpenVPN credentials in the Orchid app, and even combine them with other privacy providers to construct multi-hop routes. PIA is one of six bandwidth providers on the Orchid network.

Private Internet Access and Orchid share a vision of building an Internet where users can reach their full creative potential without the fear of being watched or silenced.

Christel Dahlskjaer, Chief Communications Officer of Private Internet Access, said:

> We are excited to be partnering with Orchid and believe that the decentralized approach is one that will not only help protect the most basic of human rights, privacy but also help restore our individual agency and bring back power to people on a global scale. The high focus on attack prevention makes Orchid an excellent choice for those whose privacy is at the most significant risk. The Internet increasingly consists of walled gardens, and we are looking forward to Orchid taking root and growing into a must-have privacy tool for you and me."

Dr. Steven Waterhouse, Orchid’s Co-Founder and CEO said:

> Selecting the right partners is one of the most important factors for building a successful business and PIA is just that — a perfect partner for Orchid. Not all VPNs are equal in terms of protecting users. PIA deeply shares our values and is the gold standard when it comes to handling user data. Privacy is a community experience and PIA is an important member of our network."
