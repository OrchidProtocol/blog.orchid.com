OXT, the Orchid token, is now listed on [Huobi](https://www.huobi.com/en-us/), a global digital asset exchange with prominence in Asia, as Orchid expands deeper into the continent and around the world.

With a team dedicated to providing safe, professional, trustworthy, and world class services to its global clients, Huobi has over 1,300 employees and established subsidiary companies and partnership companies in 12 countries, including Japan, Thailand, Gibraltar and the United States.

New users can open an Orchid account by purchasing at least $4 in OXT and $1 of ETH on Huobi. Once the account is created, a shareable QR code will appear that contains account credentials. Anyone can copy or scan that account into the app for a simple, one-step setup.

Orchid's unique VPN marketplace uses a robust system of incentives to match supply with demand and ensure ample bandwidth is available. People use OXT to fund their account, and can then purchase VPN service on a pay-as-you-go basis.

Dr. Steven Waterhouse, Orchid's Co-Founder and CEO said: "This new listing underscores Orchid's strong global expansion, particularly across Asia. Huobi is a leading outlet for cryptocurrencies in Asia and around the world. We're thrilled that people can now use Huobi to get OXT and explore the Internet more freely."

Established in 2013, Huobi has become one of the world's largest digital asset exchanges with an accumulated trading volume of US $1 trillion. Huobi now serves more than 5 million users in over 130 countries around the world.
