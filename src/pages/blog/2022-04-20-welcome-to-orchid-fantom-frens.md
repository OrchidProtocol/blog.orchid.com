Orchid's decentralized VPN is now live on Fantom network! Now you can fund an Orchid account using FTM on Fantom's EVM-compatible blockchain.

Orchid is a decentralized bandwidth marketplace. You can pay as you go ($0.06/GB) to use Orchid's VPN app to break out of firewall blocks and protect your privacy when browsing online. Bandwidth providers receive payments in real-time as they provide service and stake OXT to compete for service requests.

Unlike most VPNs, Orchid is decentralized --- meaning there is no server that stores your web browsing data or history.

Check out how Orchid's L2 nanopayment system works. Start by making an account, funding it with FTM on Fantom Chain, and connecting to Orchid's VPN app. 

Why Fantom? 
------------

Fantom describes itself as a high-performance, scalable, EVM-compatible, and secure smart-contract platform. The consensus mechanism---Lachesis---is leaderless, asynchronous and creates byzantine fault-tolerant Layer 1 blockchain protocol.

The project has [2,800,000+](https://ftmscan.com/chart/address) unique wallet addresses now active. The layer 1 is popular for Defi and gaming applications. Recently, Fantom launched an incentive program to give away an [additional 335m FTM](https://fantom.foundation/blog/new-335m-ftm-incentive-program-with-gitcoin-grants/) from the foundation to developers through Gitcoing Grants.

Orchid has adopted a multichain strategy to make sure users have a wide range of options when it comes to where they home their Orchid account. Of particular interest for users, Fantom has low fees and a novel consensus mechanism that underlies the layer 1.

"Fantom has been getting a lot of attention lately for its growth and adoption. We are happy to add the novel layer 1 to our supported list of chains." said Orchid's Head of Product, Travis Cannell. 

How to use the Orchid VPN on Fantom Chain
-----------------------------------------

The basic steps to use Orchid on Fantom are detailed [here](https://orchid.com/join). In short:

- Connect your wallet to the Fantom chain and get enough FTM in that wallet for the balance + deposit + funding fee (currently $1.2 USD worth of FTM)
- Download the Orchid app and copy the Orchid identity you want to fund
- Open the dapp at account.orchid.com
- Connect your funding wallet, switch it to the FTM chain and paste in the Orchid identity
- Add funds! The app will then have a connected, funded account

The FTM token exists as an ERC-20, BEP-2 and Opera mainnet token. In order to benefit from the low fees, you will want to purchase FTM token directly on [FTM mainnet only](https://fantom.foundation/where-to-buy-ftm/). By purchasing FTM directly onto the Opera mainnet, you avoid expensive bridging charges. For a more detailed understanding of the options, read t[he FTM token ultimate guide](https://fantom.foundation/blog/the-ultimate-guide-to-the-ftm-token/)

### About probabilistic nanopayments, Orchid's unique Layer 2 solution

Orchid's unique system of [probabilistic nanopayments](https://medium.com/orchid-labs/probabilistic-nanopayments-4aa423c3f22f) is an Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)-compatible Layer 2 solution that enables tiny amounts of money to be sent as off-chain probabilities. The technology is emerging as a new form of rollup, differentiated from zero-knowledge rollups or more traditional rollups. A "probabilistic rollup" allows for many off-chain transactions to be sent that eventually settle using probability. When users buy VPN bandwidth on Orchid, transactions are sent as nanopayments, each of which is worth approximately one one-thousandth (1/1,000) of a penny, depending upon how the account is configured. Probabilistic nanopayments allow Orchid users access to a unique pay-as-you-go model for VPN service. Orchid never charges fixed fees or monthly subscriptions (as many centralized VPNs do), making its bandwidth market truly trustless and decentralized.

Privacy is Orchid's mission. Probabilistic nanopayments, along with this integration with Aurora, are two critical components of Orchid's goal of making online privacy accessible to people everywhere -- restoring the Internet as a place of freedom and exploration in the process.
