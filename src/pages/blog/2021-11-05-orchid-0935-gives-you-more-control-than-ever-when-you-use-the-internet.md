Orchid version 0.9.35 is now available, giving people even more control over how to explore the Internet in privacy, particularly when it comes to configuring multiple [hops](https://blog.orchid.com/what-is-a-hop/).

Orchid's multi-hop feature is still the only game in town for iOS/macOS & Android users who want complete control over their devices' Internet connections. The latest update to the app adds new capabilities for multi-[hop](https://blog.orchid.com/what-is-a-hop/) settings and makes it easier for new users to get started.

Orchid version 0.9.35 introduces a **new circuit building interface** that allows for more flexible payment methods. Users can now **pay for multi-hop circuits with prepaid xDAI accounts** along with OXT. As before, the multi-hop interface also supports OpenVPN and WireGuard configurations that can be strung together into an [onion route](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Onion_routing).

The update also enables users to **manage their connections from the circuit builder interface** rather than the "Manage Accounts" menu. In technical terms, this means that all VPN connections now use a circuit with zero or more hops. All existing configurations have been migrated to the circuit builder to aid in this transition.

Finally, the latest version of Orchid includes an easy **one-tap purchase** feature that streamlines the onboarding process for users. Using this feature, people can purchase Orchid accounts and create single-hop circuits from the app's home screen.

Each of these features is designed to make Orchid's decentralized VPN marketplace easier to use, and more versatile, for anyone seeking strong online privacy.

Orchid's mission is to restore the Internet as a place of freedom and exploration. This latest update to our VPN service is another step toward a web that is both truly open and truly private.
