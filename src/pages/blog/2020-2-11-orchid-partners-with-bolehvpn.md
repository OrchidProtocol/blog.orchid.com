It takes many nodes and many service providers to build a truly global secure private network. That’s why Orchid is thrilled to announce its new partnership with BolehVPN, a privacy and anonymity service that has operated since 2007. The alliance with BolehVPN, one of the most trusted names in trusted browsing, brings the dream of a genuinely secure and private internet closer to fruition.

BolehVPN’s thousands of users already know and trust the services it offers. The provider doesn’t maintain user activity logs, and every month it publishes a warrant canary that lets users know about pending government subpoenas for customer information. 

Users can pay for private bandwidth from BolehVPN on a per-byte basis using Orchid’s native currency, OXT, available on [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/price/orchid). Existing BolehVPN subscribers can use their OpenVPN credentials in the Orchid app, and even combine them with other privacy providers to construct multi-hop routes. 

Reuben Yap, Co-Founder of BolehVPN, said: “BolehVPN is committed to providing our customers with privacy, security, and freedom from government surveillance. Orchid shares that vision, and gives our users a new way to control their privacy. We believe that digital surveillance is the most important frontier in tech right now, and we’re proud to be working alongside Orchid.”

Dr. Steven Waterhouse, Orchid’s Co-Founder and CEO said: “I’ve long admired BolehVPN’s commitment to a free internet, and I look forward to a long collaboration. Together, we are returning privacy to the web.”
