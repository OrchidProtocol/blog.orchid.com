OXT, the Orchid digital token, is available to buy, sell, and trade on [Revolut](https://www.revolut.com/en-US/), bringing the promise of online privacy to more people than ever before.

Revolut is a financial "superapp" that offers money transfer and exchange. The platform is designed to help customers improve their financial health, give them more control, and connect people seamlessly across the world. Its dozens of innovative products collectively handle more than 100 million transactions a month.

> "Orchid is leading the way when it comes to Internet privacy," said Ed Cooper, Head of Crypto at Revolut. "We're thrilled that Revolut is able to support its mission by listing OXT and making this digital token available to more people around the world."

OXT is used to purchase bandwidth on the Orchid network on a pay-as-you-go basis, and all providers must stake OXT in order to operate a node and offer service to users. In addition to OXT, people can purchase bandwidth using xDAI [for as little as \$1](https://blog.orchid.com/starting-today-it-only-costs-1-to-get-started-with-orchid/). Users can also purchase pre-filled accounts via [in-app purchases](https://blog.orchid.com/how-to-start-using-orchids-crypto-vpn-in-seconds/#:~:text=Once%20you've%20got%20the,That's%20it!) with nothing more than an ordinary credit card.

> "We are very excited that people can now get OXT on Revolut," said Dr. Steven Waterhouse, Orchid's Co-Founder and CEO. "This cutting-edge platform is a leader in building out an integrated, decentralized economy and financial system, and their decision to list OXT is further validation of Orchid's mission and progress."
