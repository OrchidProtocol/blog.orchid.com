Eight additional speakers will join an already-deep bench of experts at Orchid's [Priv8 Virtual Privacy Summit](https://www.orchid.com/priv8/) on Monday, November 15. These leaders include tech journalist and producer **Naomi Brockwell**, author **Shiv Malik**, Rivet founder **Greg Lang**, blockchain researcher **Jonathan Dotan**, crypto journalist **Leigh Cuen**, and technologist **Chjango Unchained**. Orchid CEO Dr. **Steven Waterhouse (Seven)** and community manager **Derek Silva** will round out the roster of speakers.

Priv8, a first-of-its-kind event focused on digital privacy, is a venue for experts to share their experiences, predictions, hopes, and advice with like-minded people around the world. These experts join a growing slate of distinguished speakers, including journalist, analyst, and author **Glenn Greenwald**.

**Naomi Brockwell** is an award-winning TV and film producer who hosts some of the largest blockchain and economics conferences around the world.  She is the CEO and founder of production company and casting agency Rainsworth Productions, and a contributor for Reason TV.

**Shiv Malik** is the author of two books and a former investigative ​journalist for The Guardian.

**Greg Lang** is the founder and CxO of Rivet, an open-source blockchain gateway service that makes blockchain clients operationally manageable at any scale. He is a self-described "​​Æxtropian cypherpunk, renegade, and pirate."

Jonathan also wrote and produced HBO's Emmy Award-winning series, Silicon Valley.

She also hosts the Reality Czarina YouTube channel.

Last but not least, Orchid's own CEO Dr. **Steven Waterhouse (Seven)** and Priv8 Podcast host **Derek Silva** will speak at Priv8.

These speakers will be joined by experts from many different spheres related to privacy. In a time when governments are testing the limits of individual privacy [in the name of public safety](https://www.reddit.com/r/orchid/comments/mo6ai4/priv8_kara_swisher_speaks_with_audrey_tang_on_how/), and powerful technology companies hold greater sway over public policy [than ever before](https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-big-tech-got-even-bigger-11612587632), privacy has surged to the forefront of public debate. As such, robust discussion and education around the topic are more important than ever.

Priv8 will take place virtually on **November 15th**. Register [here](https://www.orchid.com/priv8) to attend, free of charge.
