We are thrilled to announce that whistleblower and cybersecurity expert **Edward Snowden** will be the featured speaker at Orchid's first-ever Priv8 virtual summit. Priv8, a unique digital event dedicated to the future of online privacy, will take place from March 23-25. [Anyone can register for the event free of charge](https://www.orchid.com/priv8).

Priv8 is a forum that brings together experts from many different spheres related to privacy. The event will be a venue for them to share their experiences, predictions, hopes, and advice with like-minded people around the world. In a time when Covid-19 has pushed [so much of life online](/tips-for-protecting-your-privacy-while-working-from-home/) and governments have enacted a variety of [unprecedented emergency measures](/defending-freedom-in-the-time-of-coronavirus/), privacy has surged to the forefront of public debate. But the conversation is often dominated by voices whose vested interests pose a threat to real privacy. In the midst of escalating danger from governments and corporations, robust discussion and education around the topic are more important than ever.

That's why Orchid is bringing together experts and advocates from business, government, academia, and NGOs in one (virtual) space. Priv8 will take place over three days, each with its own theme related to privacy. Day One will feature Mr. Snowden along with talks and panels focusing on data privacy. Attendees can expect conversations to highlight issues surrounding conferencing and messaging tools like Zoom and WhatsApp. Day Two, with a focus on financial privacy, will welcome Founder and CEO of the Electric Coin Company **Zooko Wilcox**. Day Three will include discussions around privacy and the pandemic, as well as closing remarks from our own Co-founder and CEO **Dr. Steven Waterhouse**.

The speakers listed above will be joined by experts including Electronic Frontier Foundation Executive Director **Cindy Cohn**, Digital Minister of Taiwan **Audrey Tang**, and Executive Director at the Linux Foundation **Brian Behlendorf**, and a world-class roster of other leaders from across the privacy space.

Speakers will explore the tension between freedom and safety in the evolving debate around individual privacy. Priv8's keynotes and panels will cover topics ranging from the existential threats facing encryption to the death of cash and the rise of financial surveillance. They will focus on the different ways we communicate, transact financially, and live our lives digitally in an era of mass online surveillance.

A full schedule of events, as well as additional details about Priv8, will be made public over the coming weeks. You can register [here](https://www.orchid.com/priv8) to attend.

Privacy is Orchid's mission. It's why we built the world's first decentralized, blockchain-powered VPN marketplace to help people around the world reclaim the Internet as a place of freedom and exploration. Part of this mission is helping facilitate the sharing of information and insight between people, helping everyone learn about the importance of privacy and the challenges it faces. Priv8 is another way Orchid is working to bring the global privacy community together to further these goals. We hope to see you there.
