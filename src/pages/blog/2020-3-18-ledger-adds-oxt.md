Today, Orchid announces its new integration with [Ledger](https://www.ledger.com/), the creators of the world’s most popular hardware wallet, the [Ledger Nano S](https://shop.ledger.com/products/ledger-nano-s). With this collaboration, we’re thrilled to welcome Ledger’s global community into ours.

Orchid is a unique VPN because it requires OXT to fund an account. New Orchid users can open an account by creating an Ethereum address using BRD and purchasing at least $4 in OXT (you can [get it on Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/price/orchid)) and $1 of ETH. Once the account is created, a shareable QR code appears that contains account credentials. Anyone can copy or scan that account into the app for a 1-step setup. 

Ledger wallet holders with up-to-date firmware can use their devices to store, trade, and transfer OXT, the token that Orchid uses to power its international privacy network. Ledger’s many thousands of active users now have a powerful new tool for secure, safe, and private internet browsing.

Pascal Gauthier, Ledger CEO, said: “"We are very glad to support Orchid's digital currency (OXT) in Ledger Live. It reflects our will to bolster all of the very engaged coin communities and our ability to scale by integrating new projects in Ledger Live. Furthermore, Orchid's underlying values and features are in line with what Ledger has fought for since its beginning."

Dr. Steven Waterhouse, Orchid’s Co-Founder and CEO, said: “Ledger wallets have earned their incredible popularity, and we’re very excited that our community will be able to store their OXT on a trusted Ledger device. Now more than ever, it’s simple for crypto users to take back their privacy.”
