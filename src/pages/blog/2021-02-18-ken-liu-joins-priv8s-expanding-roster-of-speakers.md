We are excited to announce that award-winning author **Ken Liu** will speak at Orchid's [Priv8 Virtual Privacy Summit](https://www.orchid.com/priv8/). Priv8, a first-of-its-kind event focused on digital privacy, is a venue for experts and advocates to share their experiences, predictions, hopes, and advice with like-minded people around the world. Ken joins a growing slate of distinguished speakers, including whistleblower and cybersecurity expert **Edward Snowden**, Electronic Frontier Foundation Executive Director **Cindy Cohn**, Digital Minister of Taiwan **Audrey Tang**, Executive and Director at the Linux Foundation **Brian Behlendorf**.

Ken is a three-time winner of the prestigious [Hugo Award](http://www.thehugoawards.org/about/) for science fiction writing. His story "The Paper Menagerie" was the first work of fiction to win three genre literary awards: the Hugo, the Nebula, and the World Fantasy Award. Ken's work, set in the future or in alternate worlds, shine a light on important contemporary social issues and questions. In particular, he explores the ways powerful technology can pose a danger to society if employed toward cynical or malicious ends.

At Priv8, Ken will be joined by experts from many different spheres related to privacy. In a time when Covid-19 has pushed [so much of life](/tips-for-protecting-your-privacy-while-working-from-home/) online and governments have enacted a variety of [unprecedented emergency measures](/defending-freedom-in-the-time-of-coronavirus/), privacy has surged to the forefront of public debate. In the midst of escalating danger from governments and corporations, robust discussion and education around the topic are more important than ever.

Priv8 will take place over three days, from March **23-25**. A full schedule of events, as well as additional details about Priv8, will be made public over the coming weeks. You can register [here](https://www.orchid.com/priv8) to attend.
