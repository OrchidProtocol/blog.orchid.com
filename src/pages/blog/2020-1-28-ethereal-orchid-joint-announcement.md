As we recognize Data Privacy Day this year, we’re excited to announce that we’ve joined forces with Ethereal as their official privacy partner. This May at the [Ethereal Summit](https://www.etherealsummit.com/) in New York, we’ll be working with the Ethereal team to help attendees gain better digital privacy tools and practices.

In Ethereal, we have a partner committed to furthering the important conversation around privacy, and how it intersects with the blockchain and decentralization movement. With a diverse set of voices—including artists, startups, developers, entrepreneurs, and academics—Ethereal helps tell the story of why decentralized technologies are important, focusing on societal issues, core truths, and human impacts.

At Orchid, we’re committed to a new model of online interaction with a focus on user privacy. We recently launched our privacy network—a decentralized next-level VPN powered by digital currency—on Ethereum. Orchid is an Open Source, peer-to-peer network that provides users with greater control of their online privacy, and access to content on the Internet regardless of their geographic location.

Thankfully, the number of voices calling for increased privacy is growing. 
For over a decade, concerned citizens, technologists, academics, and entrepreneurs have been recognizing Data Privacy Day to raise awareness in the mainstream. In some sense, these efforts have found success: Internet users are more aware of and concerned about their online data privacy than ever. Developers and businesses alike are creating tools, facilitating discussions, and working towards helping reclaim what's been lost- our online security and freedom.

But we also recognize that this awareness has been gained the hard way. Concerns over online privacy have risen in large part due to scandals that have illuminated the ubiquity and pervasiveness of data collection. People’s privacy and security have been compromised by a combination of misaligned incentives and misconduct.

Thankfully, despite entrenched resistance from those that profit from your data, people around the world are working to create digital privacy solutions. So, we look ahead with conviction on this Data Privacy Day: An international effort to empower individuals and encourage businesses to respect privacy, safeguard data, and enable trust.

The rise of blockchain and decentralized technologies provide us with an avenue to help users reclaim their power over their data, and take back their relationship with the Internet. That’s why Orchid is partnering with the Ethereal Summit this May in New York: to bring you the ideas, people, and projects attempting to disrupt the current model. We hope you’ll join us as we explore the ways in which blockchain can offer a foundation for individuals and communities to exercise self-determination and become stronger as a result.
