[OXT](https://www.orchid.com/oxt/), Orchid's native digital asset, is now listed on LATOKEN, an exchange that serves more than 1.5 million registered users. The platform, which hosts more than 240 digital assets, has been listed among CoinmarketCap's Top 20 largest exchanges [since March of 2019](https://latoken.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360000272752-What-s-LATOKEN-).

Orchid's decentralized VPN marketplace is designed to provide people everywhere with online privacy, restoring the Internet as a place of freedom, exploration, and self-expression. A series of OXT-powered incentives underpins the Orchid network, ensuring that users have access to ample VPN bandwidth at all times. By purchasing a [pre-filled account](https://blog.orchid.com/why-orchids-in-app-purchases-are-a-game-changer-for-dapp-usage/), anyone can start using Orchid in minutes with an ordinary credit card for just $1. And thanks to Orchid's innovative system of [probabilistic nanopayments](https://www.orchid.com/how-it-works), users never pay for bandwidth they don't use.

Dr. Steven Waterhouse, Orchid's Co-Founder and CEO, said: "We are glad to see OXT available on a quality exchange like LATOKEN. OXT is a key element of Orchid's privacy solution, and this listing furthers our mission to make online privacy accessible to people everywhere."
