We're excited to share that Orchid CEO Dr. Steven Waterhouse (Seven) will speak at [LisCon 2021](https://liscon.org/) on Wednesday, October 20th. Seven's talk, entitled "The Cryptopunk Ethos and the Future of Freedom," will focus on the anti-establishment origins of the Internet, the potential ramifications of centralized digital currencies, and the role that decentralization can play in a free and open digital future. The presentation will take place at 2:10 pm local time (UTC+1).

Central bank digital currencies are quickly [becoming a reality](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/cbdctracker/), raising questions about [financial censorship](https://www.eff.org/issues/financial-censorship). What happens when programmable money becomes a tool of centralized power? And how can people work to prevent the emergence of new kinds of control and surveillance?

Seven's keynote will explore these topics and discuss the ways decentralized cryptocurrencies are contributing to financial inclusion and innovation, and why they are likely to be essential tools in the battle against authoritarianism. It is part of a deep lineup of speakers at this year's event, which aims to gather Web3 thought leaders from around the globe. Seven will speak alongside other innovators including Aave CEO Stani Kulechov, Gitcoin founder Kevin Owoki, and many others.
