ETHDenver, the perennial gathering of Ethereum developers and supporters, returns this week -- and Orchid will be a featured contributor. This year's edition of ETHDenver has been reimagined as a virtual gathering for Ethereum developers, entrepreneurs, and enthusiasts. But regardless of format, the event, which runs from February 4-12, boasts a [slate of speakers](https://www.ethdenver.com/schedule) that's as impressive as ever.

On Thursday, February 11 **Orchid CEO Dr. Steven Waterhouse** (Seven) will take part in a panel entitled **"The Thing with Privacy is..."** from **3:10-3:40 PM MST**. Immediately following the panel, Seven will give a talk titled **"Decentralization is the new encryption,"** which will explore how decentralization fits into conversations around encryption and digital privacy, from **3:40-4:00 PM MST**. He will explain what we mean when we say a service is encrypted, and how products that are not end-to-end encrypted can still read and log our communications. The talk will discuss the threats facing encryption from both the public and private sectors, and explain why decentralization can be a tool to support and protect encrypted networks.

Besides Seven, ETHDenver 2021 has a long list of distinguished speakers including Vitalik Buterin, Joe Lubin, and Governor Jared Polis of Colorado. The event has a full schedule of talks, panels, and hackathons. We're looking forward to taking in as many of these presentations and discussions as we can -- and most of all, we're excited to meet and mingle with Orchid's supporters and with members of the Ethereum community more broadly.

Orchid's mission is privacy, and Ethereum is the foundation on which we have chosen to build our privacy solution. Our team is a part of the Ethereum ecosystem, and we take seriously our role as contributors to the community. That's why every year we look forward to ETHDenver, which brings Ethereum's leading experts and BUIDLers together with enthusiasts of all stripes from around the space and around the world.

We hope to see you at ETHDenver over the coming days. We are excited to mix and swap ideas with other presenters and attendees, and to share the experience we've gained as builders of an Ethereum-based privacy solution. Most of all, we're thrilled to be able to play a role in a dynamic and passionate community. Wherever you are this year, we hope to see you in Denver.
