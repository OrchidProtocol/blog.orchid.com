We're excited to announce that Orchid's command line client is now available for Windows. This beta release represents further momentum toward a full desktop client with a complete GUI and interface for Windows.

Internet privacy tools have never been more important for workers in many industries and locations, who continue to work remotely due to the ongoing covid pandemic. Earlier this year the Orchid team made the decision to prioritize desktop clients, starting with MacOS in the spring. The launch of the Windows client beta continues this momentum.

> "The Windows beta launch represents a key milestone for Orchid, making its privacy solution available to more desktop users than ever," said Orchid co-founder and CEO Dr. Steven Waterhouse. "With many people continuing to work remotely for the foreseeable future, this release is an important step in ensuring everyone is able to use the Internet in safety and privacy."

In addition to Windows, Orchid is available for [iOS and MacOS in the App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/orchid-secure-networking/id1474884867), for Android in the  [Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.orchid.Orchid&hl=en_US), and for [Linux](https://github.com/OrchidTechnologies/orchid/releases).
