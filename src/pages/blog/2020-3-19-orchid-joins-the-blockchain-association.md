At Orchid, we know that we’re not alone in our vision of a safe and private Internet. Today, we’re proud to announce that we’ve joined the Blockchain Association, the blockchain industry’s leading institutional alliance.  

Orchid co-founder and CEO Dr. Steven Waterhouse (Seven) said: “The Blockchain Association comprises many of the most visionary projects, firms, and institutions in blockchain. We are honored and excited to join their ranks as we collaborate on building a more secure Internet.”

“We’re lucky to work with some of the most innovative companies in the blockchain ecosystem, and we’re pleased to add Orchid’s perspective to our community in support of clear, responsive U.S. regulations. In an era of increasing digital surveillance capabilities, Orchid’s project returns online freedom to users, a service that will only become more vital in the years to come,” noted Kristin Smith, executive director of the Blockchain Association.

As a blockchain-powered platform, Orchid has a responsibility to promote the acceptance, growth, and understanding of blockchain technology. The Blockchain Association is a leading industry group fully committed to the growth, expansion, and understanding of technologies that can transform the ways we live and do business. By collaborating with regulators and policymakers, the Blockchain Association is working to craft and support clear regulations that will spur growth in the blockchain economy for decades to come.
