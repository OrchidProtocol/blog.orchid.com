We are thrilled to announce that Messari's **Ryan Selkis** will speak at Orchid's [Priv8 Virtual Privacy Summit](https://www.orchid.com/priv8/). Priv8, a first-of-its-kind event focused on digital privacy, is a venue for experts advocates to share their experiences, predictions, hopes, and advice with like-minded people around the world. Ryan joins a expanding stable of distinguished speakers, including whistleblower and cybersecurity expert **Edward Snowden**,  Electronic Frontier Foundation Executive Director **Cindy Cohn**, Digital Minister of Taiwan **Audrey Tang**, Executive and Director at the Linux Foundation **Brian Behlendorf**.

Ryan is co-founder and CEO of Messari, which is building an open data library for the crypto asset class. He is a frequent media contributor and speaker on topics related to digital assets and decentralized technologies. Selkis was among a cadre of people in the crypto industry who [correctly recognized early on](https://twitter.com/delitzer/status/1236881676820606976?s=20) the enormous impact the coronavirus pandemic would have in 2020. At Priv8, he will explore the ways the ongoing pandemic is shaping attitudes toward privacy, as well as the trends that have emerged or accelerated as a result of the global covid crisis.

Ryan will be joined by experts from many different spheres related to privacy. In a time when Covid-19 has pushed [so much of life](/tips-for-protecting-your-privacy-while-working-from-home/) online and governments have enacted a variety of [unprecedented emergency measures](/defending-freedom-in-the-time-of-coronavirus/), privacy has surged to the forefront of public debate. In the midst of escalating danger from governments and corporations, robust discussion and education around the topic are more important than ever.

Priv8 will take place over three days, from **March 23-25**. A full schedule of events, as well as additional details about Priv8, will be made public over the coming weeks. You can register [here](https://www.orchid.com/priv8) to attend.
