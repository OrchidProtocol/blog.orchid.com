Today, Orchid announces its new integration with [TrustWallet](https://trustwallet.com/), the official cryptocurrency wallet of Binance.

TrustWallet is a decentralized repository that supports the leading cryptocurrencies, including bitcoin, ethereum, and XRP. Its built-in Web3 browser lets users operate decentralized apps without leaving TrustWallet. The application guarantees anonymity and includes multiple layers of identity security. 

New Orchid users can open an account by creating an Ethereum address using TrustWallet and purchasing at least $4 in OXT (you can [get it on Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/price/orchid)) and $1 of ETH. Once the account is created, a shareable QR code appears that contains account credentials. Anyone can copy or scan that account into the app for a 1-step setup. 

Dr. Steven Waterhouse, Orchid’s Co-Founder and CEO, said: “It’s important that our users have multiple ways of storing their OXT. TrustWallet is a leader in cryptocurrency wallets; integration with the app means that many more users will have an easy way to hold, trade, and transfer OXT. It’s a major step forward for our vision of a private internet.”
