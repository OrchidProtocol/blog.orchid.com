We are thrilled to announce that **Jen Zhu Scott** of [The Commons Project Foundation](https://thecommonsproject.org/) will speak at Orchid's [Priv8 Virtual Privacy Summit](https://www.orchid.com/priv8/). Priv8, a first-of-its-kind event focused on digital privacy, is a venue for experts to share their experiences, predictions, hopes, and advice with like-minded people around the world. Jen Zhu joins a growing slate of distinguished speakers, including whistleblower and cybersecurity expert **Edward Snowden**,  Electronic Frontier Foundation Executive Director **Cindy Cohn**, Digital Minister of Taiwan **Audrey Tang**, and Executive and Director at the Linux Foundation **Brian Behlendorf**.

At Priv8, Jen Zhu will speak on a panel entitled "Privacy and the Pandemic: Solutions Against Surveillance." In almost every field, there's a sense that the pandemic has shown us glimpses of two very different futures: one in which privacy and personal data is safeguarded, and one in which it is sacrificed to a notion of security. Can we engineer our way out of these trade-offs?

Jen Zhu will be joined by experts from many different spheres related to privacy. In a time when Covid-19 has pushed [so much of life](/tips-for-protecting-your-privacy-while-working-from-home/) online, and governments have enacted a variety of [unprecedented emergency measures](/defending-freedom-in-the-time-of-coronavirus/), privacy has surged to the forefront of public debate. In the midst of escalating danger from governments and corporations, robust discussion and education around the topic are more important than ever.

Priv8 will take place over three days, from **March 23-25**. A full schedule of events, as well as additional details about Priv8, will be made public. [Register to attend, free of charge](https://www.orchid.com/priv8).
