We are thrilled to announce that **Peter Van Valkenburgh** of Coin Center will speak at Orchid's [Priv8 Virtual Privacy Summit](https://www.orchid.com/priv8/). Priv8, a first-of-its-kind event focused on digital privacy, is a venue for experts advocates to share their experiences, predictions, hopes, and advice with like-minded people around the world. Peter joins a growing slate of distinguished speakers, including whistleblower and cybersecurity expert **Edward Snowden**,  Electronic Frontier Foundation Executive Director **Cindy Cohn**, Digital Minister of Taiwan **Audrey Tang**, Executive and Director at the Linux Foundation **Brian Behlendorf**.

Peter currently serves Coin Center's Director of Research and writes prolifically on policy related to blockchains and digital assets. At Priv8, he will discuss the possibilities for privacy and anonymity in a post-cash future of permissionless finance.

Peter will be joined by experts from many different spheres related to privacy. In a time when Covid-19 has pushed [so much of life](/tips-for-protecting-your-privacy-while-working-from-home/) online and governments have enacted a variety of [unprecedented emergency measures](/defending-freedom-in-the-time-of-coronavirus/), privacy has surged to the forefront of public debate. In the midst of escalating danger from governments and corporations, robust discussion and education around the topic are more important than ever.

Priv8 will take place over three days, from **March 23-25**. A full schedule of events, as well as additional details about Priv8, will be made public over the coming weeks. You can register [here](https://www.orchid.com/priv8) to attend.
