Orchid's unique VPN marketplace lets people reclaim the Internet as a place of freedom and curiosity with the highest level of online privacy. And now it's easier than ever to get started with Orchid using [in-app purchases](/orchid-launches-in-apple-app-store/).

Here's how to start exploring the Internet freely in just a few quick steps.

**1\. Download the Orchid App**

If you're using iOS or MacOS, download the Orchid app from the App Store. Once the app is installed, open it.

**2\. Select "Buy Orchid Credits"**

Once you've got the app open, select "Buy Orchid Credits" from the menu at the bottom of the screen. Select the type of account you wish to purchase, and complete setup by entering a credit card or using Apple Pay. When the app prompts you, just double-click to complete the payment.

That's it! You're now ready to start exploring the Internet freely with Orchid. You'll gradually draw down the money in your account, and when funds run low, you'll receive a prompt to purchase additional credits.

[Download the Orchid app](https://www.orchid.com/download) today.
