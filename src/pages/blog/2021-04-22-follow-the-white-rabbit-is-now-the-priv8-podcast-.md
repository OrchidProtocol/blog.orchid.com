Conversations about digital privacy and human rights have never been more important. In the COVID era, our lives are increasingly lived online. At the same time, it has become clear that the centralized systems and authorities that oversee so much of our digital lives are driving the development of a toxic, unequal, and divisive world. So we are thrilled to unveil [Priv8](https://www.orchid.com/podcast),  the next evolution of the Orchid podcast, formerly known as Follow the White Rabbit (FTWR).

Priv8 has been developed to support the cause of privacy by bringing experts together to share ideas in a collaborative forum. This was the driving force behind the [Priv8 Virtual Privacy Summit](https://blog.orchid.com/highlights-from-priv8-orchids-virtual-privacy-summit/), a first-of-its-kind event that Orchid held in March of 2021. The Summit brought together a global pool of digital privacy experts, academics, and evangelists including Edward Snowden, Audrey Tang, and Kara Swisher.

Just like FTWR, Priv8 will deliver weekly doses of expert commentary on key issues related to privacy, human rights and technology. Along with the new name, Derek E. Silva -- whom many of you already know -- will be taking over as Priv8's new host.

Derek picks up the baton from Alex Kehaya, who hosted FTWR from its inception nearly a year ago. During his time as host, Alex laid the groundwork for dynamic discourse on privacy, democracy and human rights in the digital age. The Orchid team is proud of the work that Alex has done, and knows that Derek will carry the Priv8  torch well into the future.

**Privacy starts with community**

With the launch of Priv8, the Orchid team hopes to further promote discussion and connection throughout the world of digital privacy. Continuing the dialogue that was set in motion at the Priv8 Summit, each week Derek will speak with experts in the digital privacy sphere, including some of those that were present for the event.

Our podcast guests will continue to share invaluable insights into the future of digital privacy. Experts from many fields have already helped move the conversation around privacy and the ways it intersects with technology, democracy, human rights, and more. Now with upcoming guests such as Avichal Garg and Dragana Kaurin, we're incorporating the momentum and energy of Priv8 to bring an even sharper focus on the key issues around privacy to the interview seat.
