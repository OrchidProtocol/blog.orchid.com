We are thrilled to announce that technology journalist **Tor Bair** will speak at Orchid's [Priv8 Virtual Privacy Summit](https://www.orchid.com/priv8/). Priv8, a first-of-its-kind event focused on digital privacy, is a venue for experts to share their experiences, predictions, hopes, and advice with like-minded people around the world. Tor joins a growing slate of distinguished speakers, including journalist, analyst, and author **Glenn Greenwald**.

Tor is the founder of Secret Foundation, a privacy-focused organization dedicated to building, researching, and scaling the adoption of decentralized technologies for the public good. He previously ran growth, marketing, and community strategy and operations for Enigma. Tor is also a renowned advisor in the blockchain space, and the host of "Sharing Secrets," a podcast exploring ways to build a more decentralized and empowered future.

Tor will be joined by experts from many different spheres related to privacy. In a time when governments are testing the limits of individual privacy [in the name of public safety](https://www.reddit.com/r/orchid/comments/mo6ai4/priv8_kara_swisher_speaks_with_audrey_tang_on_how/), and powerful technology companies hold greater sway over public policy [than ever before](https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-big-tech-got-even-bigger-11612587632), privacy has surged to the forefront of public debate. As such, robust discussion and education around the topic are more important than ever.

Priv8 will take place virtually on **November 15th**. A full schedule of events, as well as additional details about Priv8, will be made public ahead of the event. Register [here](https://www.orchid.com/priv8) to attend, free of charge.
