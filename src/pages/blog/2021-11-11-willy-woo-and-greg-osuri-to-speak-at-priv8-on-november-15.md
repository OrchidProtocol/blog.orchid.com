We are thrilled to announce that Bitcoin market analyst **Willy Woo** and Akash Network CEO **Greg Osuri** will speak at Orchid's [Priv8 Virtual Privacy Summit](https://www.orchid.com/priv8/). Priv8, a first-of-its-kind event focused on digital privacy, is a venue for experts to share their experiences, predictions, hopes, and advice with like-minded people around the world. Willy and Greg join a growing slate of distinguished speakers, including journalist, analyst, and author **Glenn Greenwald**.

**Willy Woo** is an author, investor, technologist, and cryptocurrency advocate. He has previously contributed content to Forbes and CoinDesk. Today, Willy is best known for The Bitcoin Forecast, a subscription newsletter featuring predictions on general trends in Bitcoin's price movements.

**Greg Osuri** is the founder and CEO of Akash Network, an open-source, decentralized cloud computing marketplace. He is also the Founder and CEO of Overclock Labs, a company that develops protocols, tools, and infrastructure for blockchain technology. Greg previously held a number of titles across the tech space, including VP of Engineering at Gridbag, Lead Architect at Marketron, and CTO at AngelHack.

Willy and Greg will be joined by experts from many different spheres related to privacy. In a time when governments are testing the limits of individual privacy [in the name of public safety](https://www.reddit.com/r/orchid/comments/mo6ai4/priv8_kara_swisher_speaks_with_audrey_tang_on_how/), and powerful technology companies hold greater sway over public policy [than ever before](https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-big-tech-got-even-bigger-11612587632), privacy has surged to the forefront of public debate. As such, robust discussion and education around the topic are more important than ever.

Priv8 will take place virtually on **November 15th**. Register [here](https://www.orchid.com/priv8) to attend, free of charge.
