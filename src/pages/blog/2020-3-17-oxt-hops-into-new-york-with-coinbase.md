Just after launching our privacy network in December, the digital currency (OXT) that powers our app was listed on Coinbase, giving millions of privacy-seekers access to it right away. Now, Coinbase is offering OXT to its New York users for the first time. 

Orchid CEO Dr. Steven Waterhouse (Seven) said: “Privacy is important everywhere, not just in places where censorship and surveillance are most prevalent and oppressive. Opening our privacy network to the people of New York is an important step in solidifying our global community. We look forward to making the internet open for everyone.” 

Orchid is a unique VPN: it is powered by a digital currency, so paying for bandwidth doesn’t require any centralized party. VPN service in the app is purchased with OXT from the connected account, and you pay only for the bandwidth that you actually use. New Orchid users can open an account by creating an Ethereum address using Metamask or another Ethereum wallet, and purchasing at least $4 in OXT and $1 of ETH. 

Once the account is created, a QR code appears that contains account credentials that you can share with as many friends, family, or devices as you’d like. Anyone can copy or scan that account into the app for a 1-step setup.
