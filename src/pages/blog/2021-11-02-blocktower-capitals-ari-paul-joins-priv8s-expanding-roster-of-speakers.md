We are thrilled to announce that **Ari Paul** of BlockTower Capital will speak at Orchid's [Priv8 Virtual Privacy Summit](https://www.orchid.com/priv8/). Priv8, a first-of-its-kind event focused on digital privacy, is a venue for experts to share their experiences, predictions, hopes, and advice with like-minded people around the world. Ari joins a growing slate of distinguished speakers, including journalist, analyst, and author **Glenn Greenwald**.

Ari is the co-founder and CIO of BlockTower Capital. He was previously a portfolio manager for the University of Chicago's $8 billion endowment, and a derivatives market maker and proprietary trader for Susquehanna International Group (SIG).

Ari will be joined by experts from many different spheres related to privacy. In a time when governments are testing the limits of individual privacy [in the name of public safety](https://www.reddit.com/r/orchid/comments/mo6ai4/priv8_kara_swisher_speaks_with_audrey_tang_on_how/), and powerful technology companies hold greater sway over public policy [than ever before](https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-big-tech-got-even-bigger-11612587632), privacy has surged to the forefront of public debate. As such, robust discussion and education around the topic are more important than ever.

Priv8 will take place virtually on **November 15th**. A full schedule of events, as well as additional details about Priv8, will be made public ahead of the event. Register [here](https://www.orchid.com/priv8) to attend, free of charge.
