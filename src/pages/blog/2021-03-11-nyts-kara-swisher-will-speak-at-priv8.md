We are thrilled to announce that **Kara Swisher** of *The New York Times* will speak at Orchid's [Priv8 Virtual Privacy Summit](https://www.orchid.com/priv8/). Kara will sit down with Taiwan's Digital Minister Audrey Tang for an enlightening discussion of the ways in which democracy can be an advantage in combating the Covid-19 pandemic.

Priv8, a first-of-its-kind event focused on digital privacy, is a venue for experts to share their experiences, predictions, hopes, and advice with like-minded people around the world. Kara joins a growing slate of distinguished speakers, including whistleblower and cybersecurity expert **Edward Snowden**,  Electronic Frontier Foundation Executive Director **Cindy Cohn**, Digital Minister of Taiwan **Audrey Tang**, and Executive and Director at the Linux Foundation **Brian Behlendorf**.

In addition to her work as an Opinion Writer for the *Times*, Kara is a contributing editor at *New York* and host of the popular "[Sway](https://www.nytimes.com/column/sway)" podcast, as well as co-host of the podcast "[Pivot](https://podcasts.voxmedia.com/show/pivot)." She has been [called](https://www.fastcompany.com/90475425/queer-50-kara-swisher) "tech's most outspoken watchdog."

At Priv8, Kara will be joined by experts from many different spheres related to privacy. In a time when [so much of life](/tips-for-protecting-your-privacy-while-working-from-home/) has been pushed online, and governments have enacted a variety of [unprecedented emergency measures](/defending-freedom-in-the-time-of-coronavirus/), privacy has surged to the forefront of public debate. In the midst of escalating danger from governments and corporations, robust discussion and education around the topic are more important than ever.

Priv8 will take place over three days, from *March 23-25*. A full schedule of events, as well as additional details about Priv8, will be made public. Register [here](https://www.orchid.com/priv8) to attend, free of charge.
