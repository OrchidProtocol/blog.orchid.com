Here’s a recap of what we’ve been up to:\n\nBlockstack Summit – Oct. 23rd\nThe 4th annual summit [https://summit.blockstack.org/] hosted by Blockstack\nbrought together an eclectic group of thought leaders, developers and\nentrepreneurs for a full day of interesting talks under the overarching theme of\n“Can’t be evil [https://medium.com/@muneeb/cant-be-evil-bc5ec16c6306].”\nDecentralization was a major talking point throughout, and we especially enjoyed\nthe great conversations sparked by the various presentations of the day. \n\nA highlight of the event was the panel discussion titled The Evolution of\nCapitalism, moderated by David Wachsman, CEO of Wachsman. He was joined on the\nmain stage by Richard Muirhead, founding partner of Fabric Ventures, and our own\nCEO, Dr. Steven Waterhouse. The panel provided some interesting scope for\ndiscussion on a topic near and dear to our hearts here at Orchid, and we’re so\npleased to have been able to participate.\n\nSan Francisco Blockchain Week – Oct. 28th to Nov. 1st\nOpening with the CryptoEconomics Security Conference (CESC), San Francisco\nBlockchain Week 2019 [https://sfblockchainweek.io/agenda] was another\naction-packed event with plenty to experience and learn. We had a blast meeting\nall the people who stopped by our booth at CESC [https://cesc.io/]and the\nBlockchain Career Fair at UC Berkeley; it was a great opportunity to connect\nwith some bright minds and share what the Orchid Protocol is all about!\n\nThings kicked into high gear on Tuesday night for our Follow the White Rabbit to\nWonderland SFBW afterparty. Held at Hotel San Francisco, it was an evening to\nlet loose and enjoy some good music, drinks and great company—not to mention\nsome fun costumes in the spirit of Lewis Carroll’s fantastic tale! \n\nEpicenter, SF Blockchain Week’s main event, followed from October 31st to\nNovember 1st. Top blockchain developers, investors and academics convened for an\nimpressive series of talks, panel discussions and workshops geared toward every\ninterest imaginable. \n\nOne session we found particularly compelling was the panel discussion How Will\nCryptocurrencies Help Protect Human Rights Under Dictatorial Regimes? Alex\nGladstein of the Human Rights Foundation affirmed that blockchain technology has\na major role to play in increasing freedom around the world. At Orchid, we\nwholeheartedly agree\n[https://medium.com/orchid-labs/why-we-need-a-better-vpn-aebe8c352984]. \n\nDuring the last day of SFBW, our CEO Dr. Steven Waterhouse joined Muneeb Ali of\nBlockstack and Jeremy Welch of Casa for a fireside chat titled Freedom of\nOwnership, where they discussed Web3 and users owning their data—a timely topic\ngiven the growing concern about data privacy worldwide. \n\nOhio LinuxFest – Nov. 1st & 2nd\n“Open source means open to all,” according to the organizers of Ohio LinuxFest\n[https://ohiolinux.org/]. The annual technology conference and expo, held in\nColumbus, Ohio, celebrates the Linux operating system and other free and open\nsource hardware and software projects—and in accordance with its open-source\nvalues, offers basic admission free of charge. \n\nAt Orchid Labs, we share this core belief in accessibility and transparency in\ntech (which is why Orchid is 100% open source software [https://www.orchid.com/]\n). Our own Developer Advocate, Nathan Handler, attended LinuxFest this year and\nmanned a booth at the expo, spreading the word about the work we’re doing. He\nalso held two talks on November 2nd: one on the basics of blockchain and how\ndevelopers are using it, and another about the power of decentralization to\noffer users better privacy. \n\nStill going strong in its 17th year, Ohio LinuxFest promises another awesome\nevent in 2020! We’re proud to be a part of this community of freedom-loving\nprofessionals.\n\nState of Tokens – Nov. 6th\nFor anyone interested in blockchain, cryptocurrencies and STOs, the State of\nTokens event in Palo Alto was a great opportunity to network, learn a little\nsomething new, and check out some demo pitches from startups in the industry. \n\nTegan Kline, head of international business development and investor relations\nat Orchid, brought her expertise to the evening’s panel discussion about the\nstate of tokens and token investing today. Moderated by Silicon Valley\njournalist Mark Albertson, the discussion included a number of other industry\nleaders and subject matter experts: Joshua Rivera, Chief Compliance Officer and\ngeneral counsel at Blockchain Capital; Jamie Finn, co-founder of Securitize;\nAndrea Lo, head of business development at Harbor; Mike Zajko, head of sales at\nCoinList; and Mason Borda, CEO of TokenSoft.","html":"<p>From the Bay Area to Columbus, Ohio, the team at Orchid has enjoyed a whirlwind of events these past few weeks.
