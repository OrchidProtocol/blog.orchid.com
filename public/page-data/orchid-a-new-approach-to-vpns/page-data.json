This\npeer-to-peer marketplace is dynamic; clients can select single- or multi-hop\nonion routed circuits by selecting nodes randomly weighted on stake and filtered\non secondary desiderata (price, location, etc.). A single hop route has the\nbenefits of a normal VPN connection, creating a tunnel to route your traffic\nover a public network or your ISP, while a multi-hop connection provides\nadditional privacy benefits by securing your network data from any one provider.\n\nTraditional VPNs today are limited; the centralized nature of their offering\ncannot compete with the distributed properties of combining multiple different\nproviders to offer multi-hop level security. And even if a single company offers\nmultiple hop VPN routes, there is still a single centralized entity you are\nplacing your trust into. Using a distributed system allows you, as a user, to\ndistribute trust across multiple distinct VPN providers, thereby breaking apart\nthe flow of your information so no single entity can see the entire picture.\nSuch a system is not possible when purchasing a VPN service from a single\nprovider.\n\nStaking aligns incentives against operator malfeasance, and linear stake\nweighting in particular neutralizes sybil attacks. A stochastic nanopayment\nsolution scales transaction throughput, enabling a highly liquid bandwidth\nmarket without a trusted central party. Nanopayments on the scale of packets\nallow high frequency, trustless interactions by reducing the implicit floated\nbalances between transactors to miniscule levels.\n\nCore Technology\nOrchid’s technology is highly modular. Each component is intended to be somewhat\nseparable, and to interact well with a particular role in the larger ecosystem.\nAbstractly, the system involves:\n\n * Users who run the Orchid App\n * Service providers who run the Orchid Server\n * A protocol that intermediates client/server interactions\n * Several smart contracts deployed to the Ethereum blockchain that support the\n   economically sound and technically secure operation of the protocols\n\nIn pursuit of security, we have tended to remove features and design elements\nthat we did not think would continue to function basically “as is” for many\nyears.\n\nOrchid Cryptocurrency (OXT)\nOXT is expected to be a “pre-mined” cryptocurrency based on the ERC-20 standard\nthat will be used to decentralize trust between buyers and sellers in the Orchid\nmarketplace. It also functions as a tool to promote security and healthy market\ndynamics, as providers can adjust their OXT stake to remain competitive. At\nlaunch we intend there to be a limited supply of one billion (1,000,000,000). We\ndo not intend ever to create any additional OXT.\n\nOrchid Protocol\nThe Orchid software is designed to use a custom VPN protocol, similar in scope\nto OpenVPN or WireGuard. The Orchid protocol is designed for high-performance\nnetworking and runs on top of WebRTC, a common web standard, widely used to\ntransmit video and audio from inside browsers. Our protocol is intended to allow\nusers to request access to remote network resources and pay for these resources\nusing OXT via a nanopayments system.\n\nOrchid Server Design\nService providers on Orchid are anticipated to run a server similar to a typical\nVPN daemon for protocols such as OpenVPN, but which speaks the Orchid protocol.\nOrchid servers maintain registration information in a stake registry and\nprovider directory. The stake registry is optimized to enable the Orchid client\nto automatically discover random servers on behalf of users in a decentralized\nenvironment, while the provider directory allows server nodes to register\nmetadata such as geolocation or additional services offered. Collectively, the\nOrchid Servers make up the Network.\n\nThe Orchid Network Design\nOrchid uses a set of data structures stored on the Ethereum blockchain that\nallows clients to efficiently select bandwidth-sellers’ nodes.\n\nClients are expected to select nodes for proxy chains using a two-step process\nof random relative stake-weighted linear selection, followed by secondary\nconstraint filtering. The first stage linear selection is performed by the scan\nfunction on the node directory tree. The App generates a random point locally\nand passes it in as the single argument to scan, which then descends down the\nnode directory tree. The search terminates in the single unique leaf, or\ninternode, whose stake segment intersects the chosen random point.\n\nAfter selecting one or more nodes based on linear relative stake weighting, the\napp can then filter by additional criteria such as exit geolocation, latency\n(ping), price, custom node metadata tags, and arbitrary whitelists.\n\nOrchid’s Network: Random Selection + Stake Weighting\n[/orchids-network-random-selection-stake-weighting/]\n\nThe Orchid App Design\nThe Orchid App is a client similar to a typical VPN client for protocols such as\nOpenVPN, but which speaks the Orchid protocol. The Orchid network client is\nintended to go past the basic functionality offered by most VPN clients, with\nfeatures such as the ability to analyze network traffic and to pick multiple\nproviders in a multi-hop configuration. The Orchid client is accessible via iOS,\nAndroid, macOS, Linux, and (soon) Windows.\n\nOrchid Nanopayments Design\nOrchid’s structure uses a new probabilistic nanopayment system designed to allow\nthe system to scale to potentially millions of transactions per second, enabling\ndecentralized payments on a per-packet basis. This nanopayment system is the\nfoundation of the Orchid peer-to-peer bandwidth marketplace where clients pay\nNode operators OXT lottery tickets for proxy bandwidth. The system is designed\nto lower the transaction costs for small payments by amortizing transaction fees\nacross many transactions and even across multiple parties.\n\nSee Introducing Nanopayments [/introducing-nanopayments/] for more details.\n\nThe Orchid Marketplace\nThe Orchid Market is a decentralized peer-to-peer (P2P) network, which allows\nusers running the Orchid App to purchase bandwidth from one or more sellers\nrunning the Orchid server in order to form a proxy chain to a specific resource\non the Internet (such as a website).\n\nThe main participant roles in the Orchid Market are:\n\n * A user running the Orchid App who initiates proxy chain connections\n * One or more relay nodes who forward encrypted traffic (optionally)\n * An exit node who provides the final connection to an external destination\n   (e.g., a website)\n * A bandwidth seller who accepts nanopayments for traffic (either a relay or\n   exit)\n\nBandwidth sellers register their nodes on the Ethereum blockchain and user\nclients select suitable nodes for routes through calls to Ethereum smart\ncontracts. Orchid’s structure uses stake-weighting: sellers lock up OXT\ncryptocurrency to form stake deposits associated with their nodes in order to\nreceive traffic in proportion to their relative stake.\n\nConclusion\nThe various components described above collectively form Orchid. When we put the\npieces together, we are in the process of creating a new VPN product that\nharnesses the nature of decentralization to distribute trust across multiple\nproviders and ultimately give the user far more agency and control than is\navailable on the current market. By combining a decentralized design with a\nmarket-based incentive structure, we believe that users can protect their\nprivacy and control their data while creating demand to support a healthy\nmarketplace.\n\nWe anticipate in the future that the open source community developing on our\nprotocol will be working on solutions for traffic analysis resistance, payment\nanonymity, low-variance nanopayments, improved double-spend detection and\nprevention, traffic obfuscation, improved censorship resistance, whitelist\nsurety bonds, and more.\n\nAs both governments and corporations attempt to control our online interactions,\nthe VPN market is skyrocketing. But in order to achieve what users desire in a\nVPN service, we need a new model. At Orchid, we think that a peer-to-peer\nmarketplace and decentralized architecture on the Ethereum blockchain can help\npave the way for a new era of online interaction, where individuals, not\norganizations, control the future.\n\nStay Up to date with Orchid\nIf you want to keep current on the latest Orchid news and be among the first to\ntest out the network, sign up for our newsletter\n[https://www.orchid.com/#newsletter-signup] to receive launch updates.\n\nWebsite: www.orchid.com [http://www.orchid.com/]\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/OrchidProtocol\n\nLinkedin: https://www.linkedin.com/company/orchidprotocol/\n\nTelegram (Announcements): https://t.me/officialorchidlabs\n\nTelegram (Community): https://t.me/OrchidOfficial\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/OrchidProtocol/\n\nMedium: https://medium.com/orchid-labs\n\nGithub: https://github.com/OrchidProtocol\n\nReddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/orchid","html":"<p>Orchid is a decentralized, market-based system for anonymous communication and virtual private networking, including a bandwidth market where node providers stake tokens to advertise their services using the Ethereum blockchain and receive payment in OXT (Orchid’s native cryptocurrency).</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><blockquote>\n<p>Using a distributed system allows you, as a user, to distribute trust across multiple distinct VPN providers, thereby breaking apart the flow of your information so no single entity can see the entire picture.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>In the Orchid marketplace, incentives are used to create economic security and reliability between clients and servers in a permissionless way.
