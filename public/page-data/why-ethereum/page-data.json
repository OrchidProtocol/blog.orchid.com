Deciding\non the best solution required us to take a hard look at multiple options in the\nmarket, and the tradeoffs involved with each one. Though no system or solution\nis perfect, ultimately we selected Ethereum. We concluded that while its full\npotential remains unrealized, Ethereum is currently the best blockchain for us\nto execute our vision of a decentralized VPN service that could offer users\nbetter digital privacy.\n\nTo mitigate the drawbacks of building on Ethereum, we have built our own\ninnovations where needed. In particular, our own Layer 2 scaling solution, \nprobabilistic nanopayments\n[https://medium.com/orchid-labs/probabilistic-nanopayments-4aa423c3f22f], is\ndesigned to bolster speed and throughput in our specific context. In order to\ntruly foster the growth of a new decentralized Web 3.0 world, the community must\nwork together to address Ethereum’s limitations. This post explores the key\nconsiderations we made in selecting a Layer 1 blockchain platform and explores\nthe key challenges and benefits of building on Ethereum from our perspective. We\nhope it will be helpful to other entrepreneurs and blockchain projects currently\nchoosing between options for their Layer 1.\n\n1. Ethereum is the biggest blockchain for dapps\nEthereum is the leading contender to be the base layer for the most\ndecentralized applications going forward. It is already the top choice for new\nblockchain projects, with over 2,700\n[https://www.stateofthedapps.com/platforms/ethereum] dapps currently. This\nrepresents a majority of the 3,292\n[https://www.stateofthedapps.com/stats/platform/ethereum#new] total dapps\ncurrently active across all protocols. By comparison, EOS supports\n[https://www.stateofthedapps.com/rankings/platform/eos] only 320. And Ethereum\nis second only [https://coinmarketcap.com/] to Bitcoin in terms of market cap.\nSize matters: it is both an affirmation of quality from the many teams choosing\nto base their platforms on this blockchain, and it is a key indicator of future\nsuccess and adoption. The latter point is important in the context of today’s\nstill-young, fast-evolving blockchain landscape.\n\n2. Ethereum has a large, passionate community\nIn addition to having the most dapps, Ethereum has the largest community of any\nblockchain platform. There are four times as many\n[https://consensys.net/blog/blockchain-development/ethereum-has-4x-more-developers-than-any-other-crypto-ecosystem/] \ndevelopers working on Ethereum as there are on any other protocol. This is\ncrucial, because a large community is also central to achieving Orchid’s\nmission. The more participants there are in the Orchid Network, the greater the\nsecurity and capability of the Network. That Ethereum is backed by more hash\npower, more liquidity, and less volatility in price swings represents another\nadvantage. Key to our mission is bringing together bandwidth providers and\nInternet users (with an initial focus on those with blockchain savvy). So, the\nlarger the network we can tap into, the better.\n\nOne of the reasons there are so many developers on Ethereum is its fundamental\nability to run smart contracts. It uses a well-supported and well-documented\nprogramming language -- Solidity -- for this purpose. This is important, as we\nbelieve that there are likely to be, at most, a few major blockchains that end\nup dominating the space. Ethereum is currently the best positioned to establish\nitself as the blue-chip standard for decentralized platforms.\n\nThe Ethereum community’s strength lies not just in its size but in its level of\ncommitment. The number of full-time developers contributing code to Ethereum \ngrew 34%\n[https://consensys.net/blog/blockchain-development/ethereum-has-4x-more-developers-than-any-other-crypto-ecosystem/] \nbetween 2018 and 2019. Ethereum, as a project, is supported by a broad, global,\ndecentralized network of people with skills across the spectrum, from business\ndevelopment, to marketing, to engineering. Orchid’s mission is to restore and\npreserve the Internet as an unlimited world of information that people can\nexplore freely. We believe Ethereum offers the strongest community to facilitate\nthis.\n\n3. Ethereum is only pseudonymous\nOrchid is, first and foremost, about privacy. So for us, the number-one issue\nEthereum presents is that on-chain payments are not fully anonymous, but\npseudonymous. This is an obvious challenge for a project like Orchid, where both\nanonymity and economic incentives are key. Nevertheless, after investigating the\nalternatives, we came to the conclusion that there really is no decentralized\nLayer 1 solution that offers truly private payments and programmable smart\ncontracts with sufficient decentralization.\n\nAll payments made on Ethereum are visible in the public ledger. Orchid uses a\nscaling solution called probabilistic nanopayments that keeps most payments on\nthe Orchid network off-chain. After a period of weeks or months of use, payments\nwill accumulate and leave a public information trail that links a user’s\nEthereum wallet address with the wallet addresses of some of the Orchid\nproviders they have paid. The payment ticket does not reveal the particular\nserver the client was connected to, only the public key of the provider’s\nreceiving wallet. It is up to individual users to understand and determine\nwhether this amount of information leakage is a problem for their specific use\ncases. (More information can be found in our detailed FAQ\n[https://www.orchid.com/faq].) Users desiring stronger anonymity may wish to\ntake additional steps to disassociate their OXT from their identity.\n\nMany people have asked: if we are building a privacy solution, why not just use\na privacy coin design? The question is understandable. But in reality, we found\nthat privacy coins do not offer a better solution. Obtaining privacy coins from\ntop-tier exchanges, which is necessary for an app with broad utility, can be\ndifficult. This is a reflection of a wider general sentiment\n[https://themerkle.com/is-there-a-future-for-privacy-coins-in-the-united-states/] \n against\n[https://finance.yahoo.com/news/okex-korea-delists-privacy-coins-120014891.html] \nprivacy coins. We believe this would hinder our goals of making Orchid available\nto as many users as we can, first throughout the crypto community and then to\nthe mainstream.\n\nWhile pseudonymous payments are a difficult compromise for us to accept, in the\nend we decided not to make the perfect the enemy of the good. Pseudonymity poses\na real challenge, but we still believe we have developed the strongest possible\nblockchain privacy solution. Ultimately, Ethereum enables Orchid to work.\n\n4. Ethereum is slow\nThe most common criticism of Ethereum is that it does not process transactions\nfast enough. This is true: currently, Ethereum only processes 12 transactions\nper second. At this level of throughput, Orchid would not be able to scale to\nsupport a large chunk of the world's existing VPN market -- currently estimated\nat 26% of the world’s population, or over 1 billion users\n[https://blog.globalwebindex.com/chart-of-the-day/vpn-usage-2018/], and growing\nat almost 15%\n[https://www.statista.com/statistics/542817/worldwide-virtual-private-network-market/] \nper year.\n\nIn an ideal world, the Layer 1 blockchain would handle all transactions. But\nthat is not feasible with Ethereum (or any other decentralized blockchain) in\nits current form. So to solve for the inadequacy in transaction processing\nspeed, the team at Orchid developed a Layer 2 solution: probabilistic\nnanopayments. You can read about nanopayments in depth in our White Paper\n[https://www.orchid.com/whitepaper.pdf]. They partly mitigate the throughput\nissue, scaling significantly further than would be possible on Layer 1. Truly\nsuperior scalability, though, will be achieved with the release of Ethereum 2.0\n[https://docs.ethhub.io/ethereum-roadmap/ethereum-2.0/eth-2.0-phases/]. This\nupgrade, which is one of the Ethereum community’s top priorities\n[https://www.coinspeaker.com/ethereum-2-testnet-22000-validators/], could\nconceivably allow Orchid to scale much further, to billions of transactions per\nsecond — enough to serve every Internet user.\n\nThe best solution for Internet privacy\nEthereum has lots of issues, some of which pose challenges to a privacy solution\nlike Orchid. As part of the Ethereum community ourselves, we will work to help\naddress and alleviate these issues, so that this blockchain can become an even\nbetter partner for Orchid — the type of partner that does not currently exist.\nBut even now, despite its shortcomings, Ethereum presents the least friction and\nmost advantages for us in building our network and app. Orchid is a leading use\ncase for decentralization — and Ethereum is the best blockchain to build it on.","html":"<!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p><em>When we started out designing the Orchid privacy network, we faced the fundamental decision of which blockchain Layer 1 platform to build on.
