We welcome you to get set up at Orchid.com [http://orchid.com] \nand start using it today for trustless digital privacy.\n\nThe network features components designed to work together: the Orchid app (for\ndownload on Android\n[https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.orchid.Orchid&hl=en_US]), the\nOrchid VPN client that runs in the app, and the Orchid digital currency, OXT\n(available on Coinbase [https://pro.coinbase.com/trade/OXT-USD]) that powers the\nnetwork, connecting buyers and sellers of bandwidth in an open marketplace.\n\nBut the most important part of the network, what will enable it to offer users\nunprecedented digital privacy, is you. We built a privacy network because we\nbelieve that by bringing people together who value digital privacy in a world\nwhere it’s becoming scarce, and by pooling resources like Internet bandwidth —\nnot just as altruists, but as fairly incentivized market participants — we can\nsimultaneously protect ourselves and our communities. \n\nWe’re all familiar with social networks, as platforms that claim to promote\nhuman connection and sharing. However, it has become apparent that most of our\nsocial networks do the opposite, collecting value from communities in the form\nof personal data and siphoning it to a small, centralized group of individuals.\nIn contrast, our privacy network is intended to provide the growing global\ncommunity that cares with a way to free ourselves from the net of surveillance.\n\nAs we built Orchid, we spoke to many people in this community. We learned that\nour fellow Internet users consider their often involuntary participation in this\nmassive data collection experiment as a short- and long-term threat to their\nwellbeing. We heard concerns about how corporations and governments are\ncommitting our communications, search histories, and other potentially harmful\ninformation to permanent record. Our community told us they believe anyone in\nthe world should be able to pursue their curiosity, and confidently seek\nknowledge, play, connection, and culture on the Internet.\n\nThat’s why we designed Orchid as a special new kind of privacy tool that we hope\nwill help grow the privacy ecosystem and encourage more Internet users to take\nresponsibility for themselves and their communities by protecting their data.\nRather than competing with existing VPN providers, we welcomed VPN providers\nthat share our values, such as never collecting or selling user data, to provide\ntheir services on Orchid. It’s a win-win: bringing new users to values-aligned\nVPN providers, and making sure users who are happy with their services don’t\nhave to switch providers to use Orchid. It also means Orchid has bandwidth to\nmake the network usable immediately at launch.\n\nThank you to Private Internet Access [https://www.privateinternetaccess.com/],\nVPNSecure, LiquidVPN, and BolehVPN, and Bloq [https://www.bloq.com/] for\npartnering with us from day one. To everyone else who wants to sell bandwidth on\nOrchid, we welcome you too, to join our open marketplace as a seller. We will be\nreleasing detailed information on how to get set up and incentivized for selling\nbandwidth.\n\nThe Orchid app is a VPN client and privacy tool designed to give users insight\nand control over their device’s connection. Users can pay for VPN service with\nOXT on the Orchid network for more privacy than they had before. The app also\nsupports OpenVPN, so users can login with existing credentials and try the\nOrchid network later. Users also can monitor their phone’s traffic and see any\ninsecure activity, a feature that is built into the app and also free to use.\nLike all of Orchid’s software, the VPN client is Open Source, so users don’t\nhave to trust that Orchid isn’t collecting or selling user data; they can verify\nit for themselves. \n\nAnother feature that makes Orchid special is the ability to configure multi-hop\ncircuits, a first in the world of VPN clients. Instead of using only one\nprovider, which would be single-hop, Orchid users have the option to route\nthrough multiple providers. The benefit of using multiple providers is that no\nprovider can get the full picture of the user’s activity. To compare this\nbenefit to the world of physical privacy, it’s like throwing sensitive paper\nmail in the trash where it could be recovered, versus shredding it first, so\nthat the pieces could not be reassembled. Users who choose multi-hop\nconfigurations can achieve next-level digital privacy on Orchid, but should be\naware that it is an advanced feature, and is ‘use at your own risk’. Read more\ndetails at our FAQ [https://www.orchid.com/faq#security-privacy].\n\nPart of what inspired us to build Orchid was admiration for the Tor project\n[https://www.torproject.org/] and its ability to provide users with a high\ndegree of privacy. The community running Tor nodes is full of altruists driven\nto offer privacy protection to others. At Orchid, we seek to further the mission\nof providing networked privacy by incentivizing bandwidth providers, rather than\nrelying on altruism alone, in the hope that incentives bring more providers into\nthe network over the long term and produce something that is better hardened\nagainst takeover attacks. Incentives also produce a better result for users,\ngiving them more options which provide better speed and throughput.\n\nWe wanted to offer buyers and sellers the opportunity to make peer-to-peer\nmicro-transactions. It was important for us to allow users to pay directly for\njust the bandwidth they actually use. It was also important to allow users to\npay their bandwidth providers without disclosing extensive personal information\nto them, as is the case with credit card and traditional payments. That’s why\nthe Orchid digital currency, OXT, powers the Orchid network, that users of the\napp currently need in order to pay for bandwidth from providers. (In the future,\nwe anticipate our network always utilizing OXT to pay for bandwidth, but with a\nuser experience that masks Web3, so Orchid is usable by a broader community\nbeyond those versed in using digital currencies.)\n\nBandwidth providers are incentivized with OXT, which is distributed to them\nbased on how much bandwidth they provide according to our system of\nprobabilistic nanopayments. In order to become a provider and start being\nincentivized, potential providers must stake digital currency. To learn more\ndetails about how probabilistic nanopayments, Orchid’s layer-two scaling on top\nof Ethereum, works, please check out this blog\n[https://blog.orchid.com/introducing-nanopayments/]. To learn more about\nstaking, read this one\n[https://blog.orchid.com/orchids-network-random-selection-stake-weighting/].\n\nIn our FAQ [https://www.orchid.com/faq] we explain the privacy tradeoffs\nassociated with our choice to use the Ethereum blockchain, and why we made it.\nWe hope to spread awareness among users of all privacy tools that privacy is a\nspectrum, not a black-and-white binary. There are different degrees and\ndefinitions of privacy out there, and it’s important to us at Orchid to provide\nusers with  the information they need to make the right privacy decisions for\nthemselves based on their individual privacy goals and use cases.\n\nWe care about your privacy when you use our network and app, and when you visit\nour website Orchid.com. For this reason, we do not use any third-party trackers,\nsuch as the typical Google Analytics or a Facebook pixel, on our site. Your\npersonal data is not known to us or stored. The same goes with the app; we’re\nnot tracking you as you use it. It’s an unavoidable truth that collecting\ninformation on who our users are and how they’re using the product would save us\ntime and money, but as a privacy tool, that would be against our values. We\ninvite other organizations that share these values to join us and abstain from\nthird-party tracking.\n\nAt Orchid, we believe the Internet can be reclaimed by its users. It’s a shared\nresource that we should be able to explore freely, with the confidence to pursue\nour curiosity. To spread this message we’re tweeting about our launch with the\nhashtag #staycurious.

He was joined on the\nmain stage by Richard Muirhead, founding partner of Fabric Ventures, and our own\nCEO, Dr. Steven Waterhouse. The panel provided some interesting scope for\ndiscussion on a topic near and dear to our hearts here at Orchid, and we’re so\npleased to have been able to participate.\n\nSan Francisco Blockchain Week – Oct. 28th to Nov. 1st\nOpening with the CryptoEconomics Security Conference (CESC), San Francisco\nBlockchain Week 2019 [https://sfblockchainweek.io/agenda] was another\naction-packed event with plenty to experience and learn. We had a blast meeting\nall the people who stopped by our booth at CESC [https://cesc.io/]and the\nBlockchain Career Fair at UC Berkeley; it was a great opportunity to connect\nwith some bright minds and share what the Orchid Protocol is all about!\n\nThings kicked into high gear on Tuesday night for our Follow the White Rabbit to\nWonderland SFBW afterparty. Held at Hotel San Francisco, it was an evening to\nlet loose and enjoy some good music, drinks and great company—not to mention\nsome fun costumes in the spirit of Lewis Carroll’s fantastic tale! \n\nEpicenter, SF Blockchain Week’s main event, followed from October 31st to\nNovember 1st. Top blockchain developers, investors and academics convened for an\nimpressive series of talks, panel discussions and workshops geared toward every\ninterest imaginable. \n\nOne session we found particularly compelling was the panel discussion How Will\nCryptocurrencies Help Protect Human Rights Under Dictatorial Regimes? Alex\nGladstein of the Human Rights Foundation affirmed that blockchain technology has\na major role to play in increasing freedom around the world. At Orchid, we\nwholeheartedly agree\n[https://medium.com/orchid-labs/why-we-need-a-better-vpn-aebe8c352984]. \n\nDuring the last day of SFBW, our CEO Dr. Steven Waterhouse joined Muneeb Ali of\nBlockstack and Jeremy Welch of Casa for a fireside chat titled Freedom of\nOwnership, where they discussed Web3 and users owning their data—a timely topic\ngiven the growing concern about data privacy worldwide. \n\nOhio LinuxFest – Nov. 1st & 2nd\n“Open source means open to all,” according to the organizers of Ohio LinuxFest\n[https://ohiolinux.org/]. The annual technology conference and expo, held in\nColumbus, Ohio, celebrates the Linux operating system and other free and open\nsource hardware and software projects—and in accordance with its open-source\nvalues, offers basic admission free of charge. \n\nAt Orchid Labs, we share this core belief in accessibility and transparency in\ntech (which is why Orchid is 100% open source software [https://www.orchid.com/]\n). Our own Developer Advocate, Nathan Handler, attended LinuxFest this year and\nmanned a booth at the expo, spreading the word about the work we’re doing. He\nalso held two talks on November 2nd: one on the basics of blockchain and how\ndevelopers are using it, and another about the power of decentralization to\noffer users better privacy. \n\nStill going strong in its 17th year, Ohio LinuxFest promises another awesome\nevent in 2020! We’re proud to be a part of this community of freedom-loving\nprofessionals.\n\nState of Tokens – Nov. 6th\nFor anyone interested in blockchain, cryptocurrencies and STOs, the State of\nTokens event in Palo Alto was a great opportunity to network, learn a little\nsomething new, and check out some demo pitches from startups in the industry. \n\nTegan Kline, head of international business development and investor relations\nat Orchid, brought her expertise to the evening’s panel discussion about the\nstate of tokens and token investing today. Moderated by Silicon Valley\njournalist Mark Albertson, the discussion included a number of other industry\nleaders and subject matter experts: Joshua Rivera, Chief Compliance Officer and\ngeneral counsel at Blockchain Capital; Jamie Finn, co-founder of Securitize;\nAndrea Lo, head of business development at Harbor; Mike Zajko, head of sales at\nCoinList; and Mason Borda, CEO of TokenSoft.","html":"<p>From the Bay Area to Columbus, Ohio, the team at Orchid has enjoyed a whirlwind of events these past few weeks.

In reality, most VPN users do so to access\nentertainment, messaging apps, news websites, and social media\n[https://thebestvpn.com/vpn-usage-statistics/]. \n\nIn this way, we can see that the vast majority of people using VPNs in countries\nwith repressive regimes are simply doing so in order to use the internet like\nanyone else.

The viable\ndefenses against systemic attacks in an open decentralized system are ultimately\neconomic — a system is secure to the extent that the cost of an attack to an\nattacker outweighs the benefits to that attacker, or is too costly to execute\nregardless. Decentralized systems use these security parameters to secure their\nnetworks and provide incentives by which miners or participants can earn in\nreturn. Most open blockchains today use one of two models: proof-of-work, which\nrequires electricity; or proof-of-stake, which requires coordination efforts and\ngovernance. The Orchid Network is expected to use a derivative of\nproof-of-stake, called stake weighting, to authenticate peer-to-peer bandwidth\nagreements combined with Ethereum’s consensus to settle transactions.\n\nThis means that bandwidth providers stake Orchid cryptocurrency for commercial\nuse on the Orchid Network (OXT) in time-locked deposits to prove identity and\nreceive traffic in proportion to relative stake deposit size. We evolved our\ndesign to use stake-weighting after originally considering using proof-of-work,\nwhich is described in our original white paper as Medallions. We moved away from\nthat system because:\n\n * Proof-of-work creates an additional compute burden on end users\n * Proof-of-work has far lower attack costs than stake-weighting with delay,\n   even assuming rental markets\n * General compute rental markets already exist with far more relative liquidity\n   than we expect will exist in any future OXT stake deposit rental markets\n\nThe Orchid Network\nThe Orchid Network is designed to be a set of data structures stored on the\nEthereum blockchain that allows clients to efficiently select bandwidth sellers’\nnodes. Essentially, it forms a simple Orchid-specific overlay on the Ethereum\nnetwork.\n\nAt a high level, the Orchid Network is expected to provide the following key\noperations:\n\n * A means for bandwidth providers to register their nodes via staking\n * A method for bandwidth providers to register custom services and metadata\n * A means for clients to query nodes for custom services and metadata\n * A method for selecting a random node, with probability proportional to stake\n\nThe use of stake-weighting is intended to allow the economic security of the\nOrchid Network to scale linearly with the size of the total deposited stake. The\nstake-weighted selection process itself is implemented using an on-chain tree\ndata structure, which is intended to allow a client to outsource the selection\nof nodes to other nodes in a scalable trustless manner, avoiding the need for\nlightweight clients to ever download, store, or process the complete node\ndirectory.\n\nNode directory tree\nTo implement the scan function efficiently, we use an on-chain binary weighted\ntree data structure. Each node in the tree is expected to be a stake entry,\nwhich stores a stakee, an amount, and a delay, in addition to the tree pointers\nand stake subtotals for the left and right subtrees. This structure effectively\nforms a prefix sum tree over all the stake deposits, allowing a simple descent\ndecision at each node to find the subtree (or internode) containing a given\nrandom point; finding the exact node containing the given random point is\nexpected to require only a logarithmic number of steps.\n\nNode metadata registry\nThe Node metadata registry is anticipated to allow providers to ‘tag’ nodes with\nmetadata. Bandwidth providers can use this to store custom metadata associated\nwith their nodes on the blockchain and advertise services. The metadata registry\nis structured to be generic in order to enable a simple means for future custom\nextensions. This is intended to allow node operators to advertise new services,\nwhich clients can then select for without code updates.\n\nOrchid App users interested in filtering service based on certain criteria, such\nas geography, are expected to be able to use tags to do so. Since tags are\npieces of metadata added by providers, ultimately the Orchid App must check\nwhether the provider is acting honestly. In many cases, we expect the checks\nwill be automated.\n\nExamples of Metadata Tags:\n\n * Geolocation: Providers are expected to be able to advertise their service in\n   a particular region so that clients can filter based on location (similar to\n   a typical VPN service). The Orchid App will use a public IP database to\n   confirm the location.\n * Latency: In some cases users will desire connections with lower latency than\n   randomly chosen nodes. The Orchid App is designed to employ a\n   ‘guess-and-check’ strategy by using the same public IP database to find\n   routes with a shorter distance. Ultimately, the actual latency must be\n   measured once a route is constructed. If the latency is higher than the\n   target threshold, we expect that a new, different route must be sampled. The\n   lightweight nature of Orchid routes and nanopayments is anticipated to allow\n   for fast route setup and parallel route testing.\n * Price: Providers are anticipated to set their bandwidth prices and the client\n   can filter on price. The Orchid App intends to use a budgeting algorithm to\n   determine a current spending cap based on the user’s balance and a target\n   timespan representing how long the budget should last.\n\nCurated lists\nThe Orchid App is designed to also filter based on arbitrary exit or relay node\nlists, which limits the viable nodes to a custom subset. Initial releases of the\nofficial Orchid App is expected to use this feature to prevent certain kinds of\nattacks from malicious exit nodes (e.g. SSL downgrade attacks) by using a\ndefault exit node list consisting of trusted VPN partners. Customized Orchid\nclients can use their own lists, and eventually we expect well known third\nparties to emerge as whitelist curators. Curated lists are a simple means for\nthe importation of external reputational trust to supplement the economic,\nincentive-based trust provided by staking.\n\nHow to sell bandwidth on Orchid\nThe Orchid Market uses a decentralized architecture to connect users to\nbandwidth providers via tokenized, peer-to-peer commercial nano-transactions.\n\nTo sell bandwidth, providers register nodes on the Ethereum blockchain, which\nclients select through calls to Ethereum smart contracts. The user running the\nOrchid App then initiates proxy chain connections, which connect through one or\nmore relay nodes before an exit node to their destination. Clients are expected\nto pay bandwidth providers to forward packets using probabilistic nanopayments.\nOccasionally the seller is expected to receive a winning nanopayment ticket\nwhich they redeem for Orchid Tokens (OXT) through a smart contract function\ncall.\n\nA requirement for registering a node in the Orchid Network is to stake OXT. The\nsize of the stake is crucial for the stake-weighted selection and the more OXT\nthat is staked, the greater the probability that the provider will receive\nrequests for traffic from the Orchid App users.\n\nWe anticipate that there are three steps to earning as a Node operator:\n\n * Acquire OXT: Buy OXT tokens from an exchange or recieve OXT in a wallet\n   through transfer, or earn OXT by registering as a node provider.\n * Stake OXT: Deposit OXT tokens into the node directory contract\n * Provide: Sell services to the Orchid App users\n * Payment: Receive OXT payment for services in a provider controlled wallet\n\nUser stake deposit\nFor Orchid App users to join the network, they must have a valid deposit in the\nnanopayment smart contract in order to issue tickets to a provider in exchange\nfor bandwidth. A small portion of this deposit is intended to be held in escrow\nas a user “stake” to align their incentives with that of the network as a whole.\n\nHow nodes are selected\nApps are expected to select nodes for proxy chains using a two-step process of\nrandom relative stake-weighted linear selection followed by secondary constraint\nfiltering. The first stage linear selection is designed to be performed by the\nscan function on the node directory tree. The App generates a random point\nlocally and passes it on as the single argument to scan, which then descends\ndown the node directory tree. The search terminates in the single unique leaf —\nor internode — whose stake segment intersects the chosen random point.\n\nUsing a smart contract to implement the main node scan function allows the\nselection process to be easily outsourced to server nodes. A client requests one\nor more scan calls and a remote server node executes each scan locally and send\nback simple proofs of the execution trace.\n\nAfter selecting one or more nodes based on linear relative stake weighting, it\nis designed such that the client can then filter by additional criteria such as\nexit location, latency (ping), price, custom node metadata tags, and arbitrary\nwhitelists.\n\nStake withdrawal delay\nOrchid stake deposits can not be withdrawn immediately; they are subject to an\nintentional withdrawal delay limitation. The withdrawal delay is an important\nsecurity restriction. It creates an obstacle for attackers attempting to acquire\na large portion of Orchid App connection requests. In particular, it helps\nprevent a systemic takeover attack. This is an attack in which an adversary\nacquires a large fraction of the total deposit stake and then directs clients to\nmalicious servers, which provide intentionally poor connections, log and report\ntraffic, or attempt active connection attacks (e.g. SSL downgrades).\n\nWe believe the main defense against systemic takeover attacks is the high cost\nbarrier to acquiring and locking up a significant fraction of the total OXT\nstake. Without a withdrawal delay, this barrier becomes simply an issue of\naccess to sufficient liquidity, with little actual net cost to an attack.\n\nA sufficiently long withdrawal delay is more likely to create an additional loss\nfor the attacker when they finally end the attack and sell their large OXT\nposition. The App software then filters based on withdrawal delay, ignoring\nstake deposits with delays that do not meet the App threshold. Orchid’s initial\nApp software will accept withdrawal delays of three months or greater, but the\nflexible parameterization allows future App updates to change this parameter\nwithout the equivalent of a hard fork and associated coordination difficulties.\n\nConclusion\nBy adopting a stake-weighting approach to disincentivize attacks and creating an\nincentivized marketplace backed by the Orchid Token, we’re one step closer to\nachieving our ultimate goal: making the Internet a more open, inclusive space\nfor users around the world. Whether you want to purchase or sell resources using\nthe Orchid, the Orchid Network is designed to give users private and secure\naccess to the internet, regardless of geographic location.

This\npeer-to-peer marketplace is dynamic; clients can select single- or multi-hop\nonion routed circuits by selecting nodes randomly weighted on stake and filtered\non secondary desiderata (price, location, etc.). A single hop route has the\nbenefits of a normal VPN connection, creating a tunnel to route your traffic\nover a public network or your ISP, while a multi-hop connection provides\nadditional privacy benefits by securing your network data from any one provider.\n\nTraditional VPNs today are limited; the centralized nature of their offering\ncannot compete with the distributed properties of combining multiple different\nproviders to offer multi-hop level security. And even if a single company offers\nmultiple hop VPN routes, there is still a single centralized entity you are\nplacing your trust into. Using a distributed system allows you, as a user, to\ndistribute trust across multiple distinct VPN providers, thereby breaking apart\nthe flow of your information so no single entity can see the entire picture.\nSuch a system is not possible when purchasing a VPN service from a single\nprovider.\n\nStaking aligns incentives against operator malfeasance, and linear stake\nweighting in particular neutralizes sybil attacks. A stochastic nanopayment\nsolution scales transaction throughput, enabling a highly liquid bandwidth\nmarket without a trusted central party. Nanopayments on the scale of packets\nallow high frequency, trustless interactions by reducing the implicit floated\nbalances between transactors to miniscule levels.\n\nCore Technology\nOrchid’s technology is highly modular. Each component is intended to be somewhat\nseparable, and to interact well with a particular role in the larger ecosystem.\nAbstractly, the system involves:\n\n * Users who run the Orchid App\n * Service providers who run the Orchid Server\n * A protocol that intermediates client/server interactions\n * Several smart contracts deployed to the Ethereum blockchain that support the\n   economically sound and technically secure operation of the protocols\n\nIn pursuit of security, we have tended to remove features and design elements\nthat we did not think would continue to function basically “as is” for many\nyears.\n\nOrchid Cryptocurrency (OXT)\nOXT is expected to be a “pre-mined” cryptocurrency based on the ERC-20 standard\nthat will be used to decentralize trust between buyers and sellers in the Orchid\nmarketplace. It also functions as a tool to promote security and healthy market\ndynamics, as providers can adjust their OXT stake to remain competitive. At\nlaunch we intend there to be a limited supply of one billion (1,000,000,000). We\ndo not intend ever to create any additional OXT.\n\nOrchid Protocol\nThe Orchid software is designed to use a custom VPN protocol, similar in scope\nto OpenVPN or WireGuard. The Orchid protocol is designed for high-performance\nnetworking and runs on top of WebRTC, a common web standard, widely used to\ntransmit video and audio from inside browsers. Our protocol is intended to allow\nusers to request access to remote network resources and pay for these resources\nusing OXT via a nanopayments system.\n\nOrchid Server Design\nService providers on Orchid are anticipated to run a server similar to a typical\nVPN daemon for protocols such as OpenVPN, but which speaks the Orchid protocol.\nOrchid servers maintain registration information in a stake registry and\nprovider directory. The stake registry is optimized to enable the Orchid client\nto automatically discover random servers on behalf of users in a decentralized\nenvironment, while the provider directory allows server nodes to register\nmetadata such as geolocation or additional services offered. Collectively, the\nOrchid Servers make up the Network.\n\nThe Orchid Network Design\nOrchid uses a set of data structures stored on the Ethereum blockchain that\nallows clients to efficiently select bandwidth-sellers’ nodes.\n\nClients are expected to select nodes for proxy chains using a two-step process\nof random relative stake-weighted linear selection, followed by secondary\nconstraint filtering. The first stage linear selection is performed by the scan\nfunction on the node directory tree. The App generates a random point locally\nand passes it in as the single argument to scan, which then descends down the\nnode directory tree. The search terminates in the single unique leaf, or\ninternode, whose stake segment intersects the chosen random point.\n\nAfter selecting one or more nodes based on linear relative stake weighting, the\napp can then filter by additional criteria such as exit geolocation, latency\n(ping), price, custom node metadata tags, and arbitrary whitelists.\n\nOrchid’s Network: Random Selection + Stake Weighting\n[/orchids-network-random-selection-stake-weighting/]\n\nThe Orchid App Design\nThe Orchid App is a client similar to a typical VPN client for protocols such as\nOpenVPN, but which speaks the Orchid protocol. The Orchid network client is\nintended to go past the basic functionality offered by most VPN clients, with\nfeatures such as the ability to analyze network traffic and to pick multiple\nproviders in a multi-hop configuration. The Orchid client is accessible via iOS,\nAndroid, macOS, Linux, and (soon) Windows.\n\nOrchid Nanopayments Design\nOrchid’s structure uses a new probabilistic nanopayment system designed to allow\nthe system to scale to potentially millions of transactions per second, enabling\ndecentralized payments on a per-packet basis. This nanopayment system is the\nfoundation of the Orchid peer-to-peer bandwidth marketplace where clients pay\nNode operators OXT lottery tickets for proxy bandwidth. The system is designed\nto lower the transaction costs for small payments by amortizing transaction fees\nacross many transactions and even across multiple parties.\n\nSee Introducing Nanopayments [/introducing-nanopayments/] for more details.\n\nThe Orchid Marketplace\nThe Orchid Market is a decentralized peer-to-peer (P2P) network, which allows\nusers running the Orchid App to purchase bandwidth from one or more sellers\nrunning the Orchid server in order to form a proxy chain to a specific resource\non the Internet (such as a website).\n\nThe main participant roles in the Orchid Market are:\n\n * A user running the Orchid App who initiates proxy chain connections\n * One or more relay nodes who forward encrypted traffic (optionally)\n * An exit node who provides the final connection to an external destination\n   (e.g., a website)\n * A bandwidth seller who accepts nanopayments for traffic (either a relay or\n   exit)\n\nBandwidth sellers register their nodes on the Ethereum blockchain and user\nclients select suitable nodes for routes through calls to Ethereum smart\ncontracts. Orchid’s structure uses stake-weighting: sellers lock up OXT\ncryptocurrency to form stake deposits associated with their nodes in order to\nreceive traffic in proportion to their relative stake.\n\nConclusion\nThe various components described above collectively form Orchid.

Or do you\njust flick on the light so you don’t bump your head?\n\nAnd if you could pay for other kinds of services the same way you pay for\nelectricity — a tiny flow of resources that could be turned on or off at any\nmoment — what possibilities would that open up?\n\nOrchid’s novel layer 2 scaling architecture for Ethereum uses probabilistic\nnanopayments to allow users to pay for services in just this way. Nanopayments\nare what they sound like: they are tiny, and you can turn them on or off at\nwill. But unlike a monthly electric bill, nanopayments transmit value as they\nmove. We’re using this core technology to power our bandwidth marketplace, which\nis intended to offer users of the Orchid App a new way to construct VPN routes\nand manage them — just like flicking on a light switch.\n\nScaling payments on Ethereum with Orchid\nThe Orchid Network’s bandwidth marketplace is two-sided, comprising buyers\n(Orchid App users) and sellers (Orchid Server operators). The exchange of\nbandwidth requires a high transaction throughput to support both basic service\nand payments. Payments are expected to be made at a per-packet level with high\nfrequency. Ethereum’s layer 1 would be too slow and expensive to settle nano\ntransactions at the level of bandwidth exchange required between buyers and\nsellers in the ecosystem. To solve this issue, Orchid uses an advanced payments\narchitecture known as probabilistic nanopayments for per-packet network\npayments.\n\nExisting layer 2 scaling solutions\nSeveral layer 2 scaling proposals already exist, including the Lightning Network\n[https://lightning.network/] on Bitcoin and the Raiden Network\n[https://raiden.network/] on Ethereum. Both of these approaches fall into the\ncategory of networked payment channels, which could, in theory, serve as the\npayments layer for Orchid’s bandwidth marketplace.\n\nHowever, networked payment channels have several key disadvantages. They require\nusers to deposit and lockup funds with specific network nodes, creating\ncounterparty risk. The cost of a payment using networked payment channels is\nessentially O(log N), compared with O(C) for probabilistic payments, making them\nless scaling efficient. Network channel payments can also fail to route or fail\nto deliver in a timely manner if a single node in the circuit fails. Finally,\nthey leak payment information to more parties than stochastic payments. For\nthese reasons, network payment channels are less practical than nanopayments for\nOrchid’s use case.\n\nOrchid Nanopayments: how they work\nInstead of sending a transaction worth $1 directly, with probabilistic payments\nthe buyer could send a 1% chance of winning $100. Orchid’s design takes this to\nan extreme, with nanopayment tickets representing the value of thousandths of a\npenny, or smaller. The tickets are all sent off-chain; only when a winning\nticket is redeemed would its receiver have to make an on-chain transaction to\nclaim the face value amount, which is rare. The receiver has no way to know if a\nticket is a winner beforehand, therefore giving all tickets implied value.\n\nThe expected flow of nanopayments\n * Sender opens nanopayment account by depositing OXT into an Ethereum smart\n   contract.\n * Sender can then issue valid nanopayments, backed by the deposit, to any\n   provider on the network that is accepting payments for service.\n * Eventually, the user is expected to issue a nanopayment that “wins”, which\n   allows the provider to redeem the ticket as a payment via an on-chain\n   transaction.\n * The user may or may not need to add more OXT to their nanopayment account,\n   depending on the level of funds in the account.\n * Over time, the value transmitted on-chain will in expectation match the value\n   represented in the probabilistic nanopayments.\n\nThe graphic above demonstrates how the Orchid App users are expected to be able\nto send nanopayments to multiple providers after incurring a single deposit\nsetup on the Ethereum blockchain, as well as how the general flow of payments is\nintended to operate.\n\nWe believe the general properties of this system are well suited for a bandwidth\nmarketplace, where the user requires the ability to select different providers\nat will and for them to very quickly establish a payment-for-services\nrelationship. Users should be able to quickly change VPN providers arbitrarily\nbased on speed, availability, price and/or location. The setup of the\nnanopayment account on Ethereum is structured to be shouldered by the user, but\nis compatible with the current VPN market where users sign monthly, annual, or\neven multi-annual agreements with providers for VPN service. The Orchid user is\nexpected to have the added benefit of being able to take back the deposit from\nthe nanopayment account if they stop using the service.\n\nBalance Variance\nOrchid nanopayments do have one notable limitation: variance. Each time the\nOrchid App issues a nanopayment, there is a small independent probability of a\nwinning ticket, which would decrease the receiver’s account balance. If the\nclient’s balance was only large enough to cover a single winner, this would be a\nserious limitation. To illustrate this, imagine a client issuing tickets that\nhave a 1-in-a-million chance of $2 at a rate of 1 million per week. While on\naverage there will only be 1 winner per week, there is a reasonable probability\nthat the winning ticket will be issued on the first day or even in the first few\nhours. On the plus side, there’s also a reasonable chance the winner won’t pop\nup for a few weeks. Fortunately we believe there’s a fairly simple solution:\nclients can just deposit a multiple of the face value, thereby smoothing out the\nvariance. If we model this as a binomial distribution and if the client has $20\nin their account instead of $2, the chance of their balance being depleted twice\nas fast as expected is reduced from around 10% to about 2%.\n\nPayment Anonymity\nMost nanopayment tickets do not “win,” and therefore would not be posted\non-chain. However, rare winning tickets result in a public record on the\nEthereum blockchain. Therefore, Orchid nanopayments are only pseudo-anonymous.\nFor multi-hop circuits, it is anticipated that the Orchid client uses a separate\naccount for each hop, which helps prevent anyone tracing the circuit using\npublic payment information. As winning tickets are rare — anticipated to be\napproximately once per week in common circumstances — the public payment record\nfrom a multi-hop circuit is designed to appear essentially indistinguishable\nfrom that of a single-hop circuit. We expect that an adversary trying to trace\nthe route will learn some of the payment providers associated with a payer’s\npublic address, but the probability of two or more winning tickets to different\nnodes in the same circuit at the same time is vanishingly small, which reduces\nthe traceability of transactions.\n\nCensorship resistance\nAs on most public blockchain networks, Ethereum transactions cannot be censored\nunless their validators (miners in the Ethereum network) choose not to include\nthem in their created blocks. As blocks are mined randomly among all miners in\nproportion to hash power, the vast majority of miners would have to actively\ncensor Orchid payments to significantly disrupt the Orchid Network. For example,\nif 90% of the hash power chose not to include Orchid-related transactions, the\nOrchid Network would still function, albeit with transactions taking, on\naverage, ten times longer to confirm.\n\nA more severe form of censorship would be possible if a large group of miners —\nsay 51% — chose to censor Orchid-related transactions by rejecting blocks that\nincluded them. This would be valid according to the rules of the Ethereum\nprotocol, and would effectively create a soft fork. However, organizing\nlarge-scale miner collusion to create such a soft fork carries significant risk\nof financial loss for the colluders; if the soft fork fails to achieve\nsufficient hashing power, the colluding miners would miss out on their block\nrewards. Even without the risk of financial loss, we consider this possibility\nextremely unlikely due to the decentralized nature of Ethereum mining\ncommunities and the lack of legal and regulatory limitations on blockchain\nmining strategies.\n\nConclusion\nWe believe that Orchid nanopayments have advantages over existing payment\nchannel solutions and are optimized to provide a continuous service to users.\nThe reduction in transaction fees makes it possible to support up to millions of\nusers, without requiring any upgrades to Ethereum itself. Setup costs are not\npairwise, but are only incurred by the user to start. This means providers are\nexpected to be able to immediately begin servicing users without incurring setup\ncosts and users are expected to have the ability to switch between providers on\na whim, which we view as a design requirement for a modern-day VPN application.\n\nStay Up to date with Orchid\nIf you want to keep current on the latest Orchid news and be among the first to\ntest out the network and use the Orchid Token, sign up to our newsletter\n[https://www.orchid.com/#newsletter-signup] for launch updates.\n\nWebsite: www.orchid.com [http://www.orchid.com/]\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/OrchidProtocol\n\nLinkedin: https://www.linkedin.com/company/orchidprotocol/\n\nTelegram (Announcements): https://t.me/officialorchidlabs\n\nTelegram (Community): https://t.me/OrchidOfficial\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/OrchidProtocol/\n\nMedium: https://medium.com/orchid-labs\n\nGithub: https://github.com/OrchidProtocol\n\nReddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/orchid","html":"<p>When you wake up in the morning and flick on a light switch, do you pause to think about how many tiny fractions of a penny that electricity costs?

If we model this as a binomial distribution and if the client has $20 in their account instead of $2, the chance of their balance being depleted twice as fast as expected is reduced from around 10% to about 2%.</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><h2 id=\"paymentanonymity\">Payment Anonymity</h2>\n<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>Most nanopayment tickets do not “win,” and therefore would not be posted on-chain. However, rare winning tickets result in a public record on the Ethereum blockchain. Therefore, Orchid nanopayments are only pseudo-anonymous. For multi-hop circuits, it is anticipated that the Orchid client uses a separate account for each hop, which helps prevent anyone tracing the circuit using public payment information. As winning tickets are rare — anticipated to be approximately once per week in common circumstances — the public payment record from a multi-hop circuit is designed to appear essentially indistinguishable from that of a single-hop circuit. We expect that an adversary trying to trace the route will learn some of the payment providers associated with a payer’s public address, but the probability of two or more winning tickets to different nodes in the same circuit at the same time is vanishingly small, which reduces the traceability of transactions.</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><h2 id=\"censorshipresistance\">Censorship resistance</h2>\n<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>As on most public blockchain networks, Ethereum transactions cannot be censored unless their validators (miners in the Ethereum network) choose not to include them in their created blocks. As blocks are mined randomly among all miners in proportion to hash power, the vast majority of miners would have to actively censor Orchid payments to significantly disrupt the Orchid Network. For example, if 90% of the hash power chose not to include Orchid-related transactions, the Orchid Network would still function, albeit with transactions taking, on average, ten times longer to confirm.</p><p>A more severe form of censorship would be possible if a large group of miners — say 51% — chose to censor Orchid-related transactions by rejecting blocks that included them. This would be valid according to the rules of the Ethereum protocol, and would effectively create a soft fork. However, organizing large-scale miner collusion to create such a soft fork carries significant risk of financial loss for the colluders; if the soft fork fails to achieve sufficient hashing power, the colluding miners would miss out on their block rewards. Even without the risk of financial loss, we consider this possibility extremely unlikely due to the decentralized nature of Ethereum mining communities and the lack of legal and regulatory limitations on blockchain mining strategies.</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><h2 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h2>\n<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>We believe that Orchid nanopayments have advantages over existing payment channel solutions and are optimized to provide a continuous service to users. The reduction in transaction fees makes it possible to support up to millions of users, without requiring any upgrades to Ethereum itself. Setup costs are not pairwise, but are only incurred by the user to start. This means providers are expected to be able to immediately begin servicing users without incurring setup costs and users are expected to have the ability to switch between providers on a whim, which we view as a design requirement for a modern-day VPN application.</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><h2 id=\"stayuptodatewithorchid\">Stay Up to date with Orchid</h2>\n<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>If you want to keep current on the latest Orchid news and be among the first to test out the network and use the Orchid Token, <a href=\"https://www.orchid.com/#newsletter-signup\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">sign up to our newsletter</a> for launch updates.</p><p>Website: <a href=\"http://www.orchid.com/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">www.orchid.com</a></p><p>Twitter: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/OrchidProtocol\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">https://twitter.com/OrchidProtocol</a></p><p>Linkedin: <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/company/orchidprotocol/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">https://www.linkedin.com/company/orchidprotocol/</a></p><p>Telegram (Announcements): <a href=\"https://t.me/officialorchidlabs\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">https://t.me/officialorchidlabs</a></p><p>Telegram (Community): <a href=\"https://t.me/OrchidOfficial\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">https://t.me/OrchidOfficial</a></p><p>Facebook: <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/OrchidProtocol/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">https://www.facebook.com/OrchidProtocol/</a></p><p>Medium: <a href=\"https://medium.com/orchid-labs\" rel=\"noopener\">https://medium.com/orchid-labs</a></p><p>Github: <a href=\"https://github.com/OrchidProtocol\">https://github.com/OrchidProtocol</a></p><p>Reddit: <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/orchid\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">https://www.reddit.com/r/orchid</a></p>","url":"https://orchid-ghost-admin.circleclick.com/introducing-nanopayments/","uuid":"b77815e0-f652-4c72-aef3-d0d0823cb802","page":false,"codeinjection_foot":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_styles":null,"comment_id":"5dd46444c9410b04e25f76fe"}},{"node":{"id":"Ghost__Post__5d9cd29a616218545b68d068","title":"Pre-release Orchid App now available","slug":"pre-release-orchid-app-now-available","featured":false,"feature_image":"https://blog.orchid.com/content/images/2019/10/1_4Zlw_ZKtW8cEdITvMTDMcw-1.jpeg","excerpt":"Our initial feature is a local VPN traffic analyzer.

From their perspective, the availability of information on the\ninternet poses the greatest threat to control since the advent of the free\npress. As Ray Bradbury wrote in Fahrenheit 451, “If you don’t want a man unhappy\npolitically, don’t give him two sides to a question to worry him; give him one.\nBetter yet, give him none.”\n\nThis is the basic ethos of governments that embrace digital authoritarianism.\nAnd it goes well beyond stifling activists and dissidents.

This model relies on the idea that in order to access information and\nconnect with others, you have to give up the right to your digital self.\n\nCorporate interests monitor and harvest our every contact and click, exploiting\nthe fact that we rely on the internet for nearly every facet of our lives. They\ndelve deep into our digital selves so that they can commodify our identities.\nFor years, they’ve succeeded with only a whisper of pushback. But recent\nscandals highlighting the dangers of this model have people paying attention.\n\nBy 2017, research and polling\n[http://www.telesign.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/TeleSign-Consumer-Account-Security-Report-2016-FINAL.pdf] \nshowed that Americans no longer trusted the widespread policy of corporate data\nharvesting:\n\n * 95% of Americans are concerned about how companies use their data\n * 80% are more concerned than they were a year ago\n * 50% are looking for new ways to safeguard their data\n\nThe desire for a better internet that allows us to communicate and collaborate\nwithout censorship or data exploitation is growing around the world. The pincer\nmovement being deployed by authoritarian and corporate interests has people\nlooking to escape these two failed models of the internet, and global citizens\nare increasingly turning towards technology that helps them regain control of\ntheir digital experiences. For many, the solution is the use of a virtual\nprivate network (VPN).\n\nThe Rise of the VPN\nIn their most basic sense, VPNs are intended to allow people to access the\ninternet without fear of tracking, censorship, or having their personal\ninformation compromised. Because of this, we’re seeing a massive rise in their\nuse.\n\nApproximately 25% of internet users in the world now use a VPN each month. And\nthat rise in users has led to a massive market to capitalize on user demand.\nIndustry reports show that the VPN market is growing by billions of dollars each\nyear, and is projected to more than triple, from $15.46 billion in 2016 to $54\nbillion by 2024.\n\nYoung people are a large reason for this projected increase; 68% of VPN users\nare under the age of 35. The reasons they’re using these services are relatable\nto anyone who has the internet. The primary reason people use a VPN is to access\nentertainment content; the secondary, to gain access to social networks and\nnews.\n\nAt its core, this increased usage should be a good thing. People around the\nworld are finding ways to circumvent the restrictive, exploitative nature of the\ncurrent internet. But the reliance on VPNs to help make a better internet relies\non one basic premise: complete trust in the company behind the VPN.\n\nAs the market for VPN services grows, consumers are presented with increasing\noptions. We have to ask ourselves: Do each of these services really offer us the\nsecurity and privacy that a VPN is meant to deliver? Sadly, the answer is no.\n\nWhy Current VPNs Can’t Solve Our Biggest Challenges\nThe problems go right to the core technology of most VPNs. Today, most VPNs rely\non a centralized system, and this structure is inherently impossible to trust.\nCentralized VPNs are susceptible to firewall blockages and often rely on\nremaining compliant with governments in order to operate. By their very nature,\nthey can’t provide the user with the benefits desired.\n\nFor VPN users in nations with regimes attempting to control the flow of news and\ninformation, governments heavily regulate the VPN industry. Operating within\nmany nations means that a VPN provider has to register or get licensed with the\ngovernment. How is it possible to trust a VPN approved by a government\nattempting to control and monitor online traffic? For instance, roughly 60% of\nthe top, free VPN services are based in China. Do we have faith that the Chinese\ngovernment is allowing the services to operate without monitoring user behavior?\n\nIn nations where the population enjoys unfettered access to news and\ninformation, another threat arises — a lack of transparency on the part of VPN\nproviders. In a study of the world’s 115 most popular VPNs, 26 were found to be\nkeeping tabs on their users. While marketing language may argue otherwise, the\nbusiness model for many free VPNs is based on the provider harvesting and\nselling the users’ personal data. Buried in that fine print at the bottom of the\nterms and conditions is the acquiescence of consent.\n\nSold as a way to ensure private, secure browsing, the companies behind VPNs are\nactually tracking user data related to bandwidth, connection timestamps, IP\naddresses, and websites visited. Users who rely on services like this are often\nunaware they are being monitored and tracked. We’re left asking: To whom is the\ndata sold to and for what purpose?\n\nIn other words, while internet users are attempting to gain access free of\ncensorship and personal data mining, the services they use to do that are\ncompounding the issue by exploiting their trust. At the heart of this problem is\nthe issue of centralization. A centralized system requires complete trust on the\npart of the user, and with complete trust comes the ability to exploit it.\n\nSecurity and protection pose additional threats. The vast majority of VPNs rely\non single-hop service, which allows interested parties to discover both where\ntraffic is coming from and where it is going. Traditional VPN traffic also\nleaves a signature that is relatively easy to spot. For users in countries where\nattempting to access a news website, like the BBC, or a social network, like\nFacebook, presents the threat of imprisonment, this is a very real danger.\n\nWhile there have been genuine attempts to alleviate the above issues via the use\nof decentralized VPNs, the attempts thus far have fallen short. VPNs featuring\nthe use of decentralized servers have relied on a system of volunteers to act as\nnodes to power the system. While these services have gained some traction, the\nlack of volunteers has led to systems that lack the bandwidth, computational\ncapacity, and servers to create a truly secure, private online experience.\n\nBuilding a Better VPN\nAs people around the world migrate towards VPNs, the need for a truly\ndecentralized system with the capacity to provide everyone on Earth access to\nnews, entertainment, and communication is increasingly evident.\n\nOver the past year at Orchid, we’ve had our heads down, working to develop a new\nonline experience which delivers to everyone — regardless of geographic location\nor political reality — the internet they deserve: secure, unrestricted access to\ninformation and connectivity free of monitoring and data harvesting.\n\nThe world deserves a better internet. At Orchid, we believe that a decentralized\nsolution that eliminates the possibility of authoritarian or corporate control\ncan help provide it. If you believe that everyone on Earth should be able to\naccess the internet and enjoy an online experience free of repression and\nexploitation, we hope you’ll join us as we work towards that.","html":"<p>As dueling interests move to control the future of the internet, users around the globe are increasingly turning to VPNs.

At Orchid Labs\n[http://www.orchidprotocol.com/], our goal is to ensure that every person on\nEarth can have access to an open, decentralized, and uncensored Internet. We\nbelieve a better Internet is one that isn’t controlled by the few, but open to\nall.\n\nCurrently, Internet access for the majority of the people on Earth is censored\nand monitored. Because of this, many Internet users are blocked from freely\ncommunicating, collaborating, and accessing information. The current centralized\nsystem, which limits our ability to communicate and learn — while also\nharvesting and selling our personal data — is far from the full potential of\nwhat the internet could be and strays from the original intention of its\ncreators.\n\nThat’s why we’ve launched the Orchid Protocol, an open-source overlay network\nthat uses excess bandwidth on top of the existing Internet to ensure that people\n— no matter where they live on our planet — can have unrestricted access to\ninformation and collaboration. Orchid’s protocol combines surplus bandwidth,\nstate-of-the-art encryption, and a decentralized infrastructure enabling any\nInternet user to participate and exchange bandwidth for payment in peer-to-peer\ntransactions using Orchid tokens on the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nOur team consists of engineers, cryptocurrency experts, technologists, and\npartners dedicated to creating an Internet free of surveillance and censorship.\nThis idea isn’t new; there are people across the globe dedicated to this cause.\nWe believe the Orchid Protocol will help the world finally create this reality.\n\nWhile I’ve been interested in the idea of Internet freedom for some time, the\norigins of Orchid stem from conversations with Steve Bell, an entrepreneur with\nmore than a decade of experience backing Chinese seed stage startups. We had\nboth personally experienced and witnessed the consequences of surveillance and\ncensorship in our work across the world. My concern was one of surveillance,\nwhile Steve’s was one of censorship or access. My perspective was, “how do\ncommunicate or access information in a potentially totalitarian state in a\nprivate fashion”. I had also experience security issues first hand, both during\nthe Bitstamp hack of 2015\n[https://techcrunch.com/2015/01/05/bitstamp-bitcoin-exchange-hack/] and in\nhaving my own phone ported\n[https://medium.com/@stevewaterhouse/notes-on-recovering-from-a-hack-3cd438e10fe0]\n.\n\nWe started discussing ways to create an internet free of surveillance and\ncensorship that everyone in the world could access. With a passion for where we\nwanted to go and a firm idea of how to get there, we knew we needed the\ntechnological expertise and funding to make this happen.\n\nFortunately, we’ve met many technologists and partners who are also passionate\nabout this cause, and who believe in Orchid’s ability to transform the way that\nusers can utilize and access the Internet.\n\nOlaf Carlson-Wee from Polychain Capita [http://polychain.capital/]l is an\ninvestor who focuses on emerging Internet-based technologies. “We’ve invested in\na number of projects that I would say focus on preserving privacy on the\nInternet and enabling people to use the Internet in a more free and open way,”\nhe said. “I’d say that cryptocurrency largely falls into this category as well.\nWe invested in Orchid because we think it’s the most sophisticated project we’ve\nseen to date that’s trying to solve problems within this space.”\n\nSteve Bell had worked with open-source advocate and technologist Brian J. Fox in\nmore than one venture. Steve and Brian had been talking years earlier about the\ndifferent ways in which restrictive firewalls could be bypassed, enabling\nfreedom of speech on the Internet. When the three of us met to discuss the\nOrchid mission, it became clear that we had the makings of the core team well\nunderway. Brian had known the software engineer and developer of Cydia, Jay\nFreeman, for years, and Jay helped us take our project from concept to\ndevelopment stage.\n\nFor an expert in creating the technology for an alternative funding model, we\nturned to Gustav Simonsson, an engineer and developer who helped launch\nEthereum. Together, this team brings an immense amount of passion, experience,\nand expertise that can make the goal of an uncensored, surveillance-free\nInternet a reality. We believe that together, we’ve created a protocol that will\ntransform the current power structure of the Internet and benefit every Internet\nuser in the world.\n\nOne of our first investors, W. Bradford Stephens of Blockchain Capital\n[http://blockchain.capital/], has known and worked with me for years. “We\nsupport blockchain enabled technologies and when you have an idea that can\nimpact and empower billions of people by creating a more open and inclusive\nInternet — with the right technology and team — we realized the benefit could\naffect everyone, no matter where you are on the planet.”\n\nDFJ Venture Capital [https://dfj.com/], another of our partners, believes,\n“Mission- and purpose-driven businesses last longer. Like open-source\ncommunities working on a common goal. These galvanizing rods let people do\namazing work. You want your employees and customers to be rooting for you. You\ncan make money anywhere, whereas changing the world, it transcends your\nexistence, and money never does that.”\n\nThe Internet is the most powerful tool for gathering information and\ncollaborating that’s ever existed. At Orchid Labs, we believe in order for its\nfullest potential to be reached, this tool needs to be available for everyone,\nfree of censorship and surveillance, and it needs to protect each user’s\npersonal data.\n\nBecause of the passion and expertise of our team, and investors who believe in\nthis mission and our ability to actuate it, we have the technology, drive, and\nresources to make this dream a reality.

The viable\ndefenses against systemic attacks in an open decentralized system are ultimately\neconomic — a system is secure to the extent that the cost of an attack to an\nattacker outweighs the benefits to that attacker, or is too costly to execute\nregardless. Decentralized systems use these security parameters to secure their\nnetworks and provide incentives by which miners or participants can earn in\nreturn. Most open blockchains today use one of two models: proof-of-work, which\nrequires electricity; or proof-of-stake, which requires coordination efforts and\ngovernance. The Orchid Network is expected to use a derivative of\nproof-of-stake, called stake weighting, to authenticate peer-to-peer bandwidth\nagreements combined with Ethereum’s consensus to settle transactions.\n\nThis means that bandwidth providers stake Orchid cryptocurrency for commercial\nuse on the Orchid Network (OXT) in time-locked deposits to prove identity and\nreceive traffic in proportion to relative stake deposit size. We evolved our\ndesign to use stake-weighting after originally considering using proof-of-work,\nwhich is described in our original white paper as Medallions. We moved away from\nthat system because:\n\n * Proof-of-work creates an additional compute burden on end users\n * Proof-of-work has far lower attack costs than stake-weighting with delay,\n   even assuming rental markets\n * General compute rental markets already exist with far more relative liquidity\n   than we expect will exist in any future OXT stake deposit rental markets\n\nThe Orchid Network\nThe Orchid Network is designed to be a set of data structures stored on the\nEthereum blockchain that allows clients to efficiently select bandwidth sellers’\nnodes. Essentially, it forms a simple Orchid-specific overlay on the Ethereum\nnetwork.\n\nAt a high level, the Orchid Network is expected to provide the following key\noperations:\n\n * A means for bandwidth providers to register their nodes via staking\n * A method for bandwidth providers to register custom services and metadata\n * A means for clients to query nodes for custom services and metadata\n * A method for selecting a random node, with probability proportional to stake\n\nThe use of stake-weighting is intended to allow the economic security of the\nOrchid Network to scale linearly with the size of the total deposited stake. The\nstake-weighted selection process itself is implemented using an on-chain tree\ndata structure, which is intended to allow a client to outsource the selection\nof nodes to other nodes in a scalable trustless manner, avoiding the need for\nlightweight clients to ever download, store, or process the complete node\ndirectory.\n\nNode directory tree\nTo implement the scan function efficiently, we use an on-chain binary weighted\ntree data structure. Each node in the tree is expected to be a stake entry,\nwhich stores a stakee, an amount, and a delay, in addition to the tree pointers\nand stake subtotals for the left and right subtrees. This structure effectively\nforms a prefix sum tree over all the stake deposits, allowing a simple descent\ndecision at each node to find the subtree (or internode) containing a given\nrandom point; finding the exact node containing the given random point is\nexpected to require only a logarithmic number of steps.\n\nNode metadata registry\nThe Node metadata registry is anticipated to allow providers to ‘tag’ nodes with\nmetadata. Bandwidth providers can use this to store custom metadata associated\nwith their nodes on the blockchain and advertise services. The metadata registry\nis structured to be generic in order to enable a simple means for future custom\nextensions. This is intended to allow node operators to advertise new services,\nwhich clients can then select for without code updates.\n\nOrchid App users interested in filtering service based on certain criteria, such\nas geography, are expected to be able to use tags to do so. Since tags are\npieces of metadata added by providers, ultimately the Orchid App must check\nwhether the provider is acting honestly. In many cases, we expect the checks\nwill be automated.\n\nExamples of Metadata Tags:\n\n * Geolocation: Providers are expected to be able to advertise their service in\n   a particular region so that clients can filter based on location (similar to\n   a typical VPN service). The Orchid App will use a public IP database to\n   confirm the location.\n * Latency: In some cases users will desire connections with lower latency than\n   randomly chosen nodes. The Orchid App is designed to employ a\n   ‘guess-and-check’ strategy by using the same public IP database to find\n   routes with a shorter distance. Ultimately, the actual latency must be\n   measured once a route is constructed. If the latency is higher than the\n   target threshold, we expect that a new, different route must be sampled. The\n   lightweight nature of Orchid routes and nanopayments is anticipated to allow\n   for fast route setup and parallel route testing.\n * Price: Providers are anticipated to set their bandwidth prices and the client\n   can filter on price. The Orchid App intends to use a budgeting algorithm to\n   determine a current spending cap based on the user’s balance and a target\n   timespan representing how long the budget should last.\n\nCurated lists\nThe Orchid App is designed to also filter based on arbitrary exit or relay node\nlists, which limits the viable nodes to a custom subset. Initial releases of the\nofficial Orchid App is expected to use this feature to prevent certain kinds of\nattacks from malicious exit nodes (e.g. SSL downgrade attacks) by using a\ndefault exit node list consisting of trusted VPN partners. Customized Orchid\nclients can use their own lists, and eventually we expect well known third\nparties to emerge as whitelist curators. Curated lists are a simple means for\nthe importation of external reputational trust to supplement the economic,\nincentive-based trust provided by staking.\n\nHow to sell bandwidth on Orchid\nThe Orchid Market uses a decentralized architecture to connect users to\nbandwidth providers via tokenized, peer-to-peer commercial nano-transactions.\n\nTo sell bandwidth, providers register nodes on the Ethereum blockchain, which\nclients select through calls to Ethereum smart contracts. The user running the\nOrchid App then initiates proxy chain connections, which connect through one or\nmore relay nodes before an exit node to their destination. Clients are expected\nto pay bandwidth providers to forward packets using probabilistic nanopayments.\nOccasionally the seller is expected to receive a winning nanopayment ticket\nwhich they redeem for Orchid Tokens (OXT) through a smart contract function\ncall.\n\nA requirement for registering a node in the Orchid Network is to stake OXT. The\nsize of the stake is crucial for the stake-weighted selection and the more OXT\nthat is staked, the greater the probability that the provider will receive\nrequests for traffic from the Orchid App users.\n\nWe anticipate that there are three steps to earning as a Node operator:\n\n * Acquire OXT: Buy OXT tokens from an exchange or recieve OXT in a wallet\n   through transfer, or earn OXT by registering as a node provider.\n * Stake OXT: Deposit OXT tokens into the node directory contract\n * Provide: Sell services to the Orchid App users\n * Payment: Receive OXT payment for services in a provider controlled wallet\n\nUser stake deposit\nFor Orchid App users to join the network, they must have a valid deposit in the\nnanopayment smart contract in order to issue tickets to a provider in exchange\nfor bandwidth. A small portion of this deposit is intended to be held in escrow\nas a user “stake” to align their incentives with that of the network as a whole.\n\nHow nodes are selected\nApps are expected to select nodes for proxy chains using a two-step process of\nrandom relative stake-weighted linear selection followed by secondary constraint\nfiltering. The first stage linear selection is designed to be performed by the\nscan function on the node directory tree. The App generates a random point\nlocally and passes it on as the single argument to scan, which then descends\ndown the node directory tree. The search terminates in the single unique leaf —\nor internode — whose stake segment intersects the chosen random point.\n\nUsing a smart contract to implement the main node scan function allows the\nselection process to be easily outsourced to server nodes. A client requests one\nor more scan calls and a remote server node executes each scan locally and send\nback simple proofs of the execution trace.\n\nAfter selecting one or more nodes based on linear relative stake weighting, it\nis designed such that the client can then filter by additional criteria such as\nexit location, latency (ping), price, custom node metadata tags, and arbitrary\nwhitelists.\n\nStake withdrawal delay\nOrchid stake deposits can not be withdrawn immediately; they are subject to an\nintentional withdrawal delay limitation. The withdrawal delay is an important\nsecurity restriction. It creates an obstacle for attackers attempting to acquire\na large portion of Orchid App connection requests. In particular, it helps\nprevent a systemic takeover attack. This is an attack in which an adversary\nacquires a large fraction of the total deposit stake and then directs clients to\nmalicious servers, which provide intentionally poor connections, log and report\ntraffic, or attempt active connection attacks (e.g. SSL downgrades).\n\nWe believe the main defense against systemic takeover attacks is the high cost\nbarrier to acquiring and locking up a significant fraction of the total OXT\nstake. Without a withdrawal delay, this barrier becomes simply an issue of\naccess to sufficient liquidity, with little actual net cost to an attack.\n\nA sufficiently long withdrawal delay is more likely to create an additional loss\nfor the attacker when they finally end the attack and sell their large OXT\nposition. The App software then filters based on withdrawal delay, ignoring\nstake deposits with delays that do not meet the App threshold. Orchid’s initial\nApp software will accept withdrawal delays of three months or greater, but the\nflexible parameterization allows future App updates to change this parameter\nwithout the equivalent of a hard fork and associated coordination difficulties.\n\nConclusion\nBy adopting a stake-weighting approach to disincentivize attacks and creating an\nincentivized marketplace backed by the Orchid Token, we’re one step closer to\nachieving our ultimate goal: making the Internet a more open, inclusive space\nfor users around the world. Whether you want to purchase or sell resources using\nthe Orchid, the Orchid Network is designed to give users private and secure\naccess to the internet, regardless of geographic location.

This\npeer-to-peer marketplace is dynamic; clients can select single- or multi-hop\nonion routed circuits by selecting nodes randomly weighted on stake and filtered\non secondary desiderata (price, location, etc.). A single hop route has the\nbenefits of a normal VPN connection, creating a tunnel to route your traffic\nover a public network or your ISP, while a multi-hop connection provides\nadditional privacy benefits by securing your network data from any one provider.\n\nTraditional VPNs today are limited; the centralized nature of their offering\ncannot compete with the distributed properties of combining multiple different\nproviders to offer multi-hop level security. And even if a single company offers\nmultiple hop VPN routes, there is still a single centralized entity you are\nplacing your trust into. Using a distributed system allows you, as a user, to\ndistribute trust across multiple distinct VPN providers, thereby breaking apart\nthe flow of your information so no single entity can see the entire picture.\nSuch a system is not possible when purchasing a VPN service from a single\nprovider.\n\nStaking aligns incentives against operator malfeasance, and linear stake\nweighting in particular neutralizes sybil attacks.

The Orchid network client is\nintended to go past the basic functionality offered by most VPN clients, with\nfeatures such as the ability to analyze network traffic and to pick multiple\nproviders in a multi-hop configuration. The Orchid client is accessible via iOS,\nAndroid, macOS, Linux, and (soon) Windows.\n\nOrchid Nanopayments Design\nOrchid’s structure uses a new probabilistic nanopayment system designed to allow\nthe system to scale to potentially millions of transactions per second, enabling\ndecentralized payments on a per-packet basis. This nanopayment system is the\nfoundation of the Orchid peer-to-peer bandwidth marketplace where clients pay\nNode operators OXT lottery tickets for proxy bandwidth. The system is designed\nto lower the transaction costs for small payments by amortizing transaction fees\nacross many transactions and even across multiple parties.\n\nSee Introducing Nanopayments [/introducing-nanopayments/] for more details.\n\nThe Orchid Marketplace\nThe Orchid Market is a decentralized peer-to-peer (P2P) network, which allows\nusers running the Orchid App to purchase bandwidth from one or more sellers\nrunning the Orchid server in order to form a proxy chain to a specific resource\non the Internet (such as a website).\n\nThe main participant roles in the Orchid Market are:\n\n * A user running the Orchid App who initiates proxy chain connections\n * One or more relay nodes who forward encrypted traffic (optionally)\n * An exit node who provides the final connection to an external destination\n   (e.g., a website)\n * A bandwidth seller who accepts nanopayments for traffic (either a relay or\n   exit)\n\nBandwidth sellers register their nodes on the Ethereum blockchain and user\nclients select suitable nodes for routes through calls to Ethereum smart\ncontracts. Orchid’s structure uses stake-weighting: sellers lock up OXT\ncryptocurrency to form stake deposits associated with their nodes in order to\nreceive traffic in proportion to their relative stake.\n\nConclusion\nThe various components described above collectively form Orchid. When we put the\npieces together, we are in the process of creating a new VPN product that\nharnesses the nature of decentralization to distribute trust across multiple\nproviders and ultimately give the user far more agency and control than is\navailable on the current market. By combining a decentralized design with a\nmarket-based incentive structure, we believe that users can protect their\nprivacy and control their data while creating demand to support a healthy\nmarketplace.\n\nWe anticipate in the future that the open source community developing on our\nprotocol will be working on solutions for traffic analysis resistance, payment\nanonymity, low-variance nanopayments, improved double-spend detection and\nprevention, traffic obfuscation, improved censorship resistance, whitelist\nsurety bonds, and more.\n\nAs both governments and corporations attempt to control our online interactions,\nthe VPN market is skyrocketing. But in order to achieve what users desire in a\nVPN service, we need a new model.

Nanopayments\nare what they sound like: they are tiny, and you can turn them on or off at\nwill. But unlike a monthly electric bill, nanopayments transmit value as they\nmove. We’re using this core technology to power our bandwidth marketplace, which\nis intended to offer users of the Orchid App a new way to construct VPN routes\nand manage them — just like flicking on a light switch.\n\nScaling payments on Ethereum with Orchid\nThe Orchid Network’s bandwidth marketplace is two-sided, comprising buyers\n(Orchid App users) and sellers (Orchid Server operators). The exchange of\nbandwidth requires a high transaction throughput to support both basic service\nand payments. Payments are expected to be made at a per-packet level with high\nfrequency. Ethereum’s layer 1 would be too slow and expensive to settle nano\ntransactions at the level of bandwidth exchange required between buyers and\nsellers in the ecosystem. To solve this issue, Orchid uses an advanced payments\narchitecture known as probabilistic nanopayments for per-packet network\npayments.\n\nExisting layer 2 scaling solutions\nSeveral layer 2 scaling proposals already exist, including the Lightning Network\n[https://lightning.network/] on Bitcoin and the Raiden Network\n[https://raiden.network/] on Ethereum. Both of these approaches fall into the\ncategory of networked payment channels, which could, in theory, serve as the\npayments layer for Orchid’s bandwidth marketplace.\n\nHowever, networked payment channels have several key disadvantages. They require\nusers to deposit and lockup funds with specific network nodes, creating\ncounterparty risk. The cost of a payment using networked payment channels is\nessentially O(log N), compared with O(C) for probabilistic payments, making them\nless scaling efficient. Network channel payments can also fail to route or fail\nto deliver in a timely manner if a single node in the circuit fails. Finally,\nthey leak payment information to more parties than stochastic payments. For\nthese reasons, network payment channels are less practical than nanopayments for\nOrchid’s use case.\n\nOrchid Nanopayments: how they work\nInstead of sending a transaction worth $1 directly, with probabilistic payments\nthe buyer could send a 1% chance of winning $100. Orchid’s design takes this to\nan extreme, with nanopayment tickets representing the value of thousandths of a\npenny, or smaller. The tickets are all sent off-chain; only when a winning\nticket is redeemed would its receiver have to make an on-chain transaction to\nclaim the face value amount, which is rare. The receiver has no way to know if a\nticket is a winner beforehand, therefore giving all tickets implied value.\n\nThe expected flow of nanopayments\n * Sender opens nanopayment account by depositing OXT into an Ethereum smart\n   contract.\n * Sender can then issue valid nanopayments, backed by the deposit, to any\n   provider on the network that is accepting payments for service.\n * Eventually, the user is expected to issue a nanopayment that “wins”, which\n   allows the provider to redeem the ticket as a payment via an on-chain\n   transaction.\n * The user may or may not need to add more OXT to their nanopayment account,\n   depending on the level of funds in the account.\n * Over time, the value transmitted on-chain will in expectation match the value\n   represented in the probabilistic nanopayments.\n\nThe graphic above demonstrates how the Orchid App users are expected to be able\nto send nanopayments to multiple providers after incurring a single deposit\nsetup on the Ethereum blockchain, as well as how the general flow of payments is\nintended to operate.\n\nWe believe the general properties of this system are well suited for a bandwidth\nmarketplace, where the user requires the ability to select different providers\nat will and for them to very quickly establish a payment-for-services\nrelationship. Users should be able to quickly change VPN providers arbitrarily\nbased on speed, availability, price and/or location. The setup of the\nnanopayment account on Ethereum is structured to be shouldered by the user, but\nis compatible with the current VPN market where users sign monthly, annual, or\neven multi-annual agreements with providers for VPN service. The Orchid user is\nexpected to have the added benefit of being able to take back the deposit from\nthe nanopayment account if they stop using the service.\n\nBalance Variance\nOrchid nanopayments do have one notable limitation: variance. Each time the\nOrchid App issues a nanopayment, there is a small independent probability of a\nwinning ticket, which would decrease the receiver’s account balance. If the\nclient’s balance was only large enough to cover a single winner, this would be a\nserious limitation. To illustrate this, imagine a client issuing tickets that\nhave a 1-in-a-million chance of $2 at a rate of 1 million per week. While on\naverage there will only be 1 winner per week, there is a reasonable probability\nthat the winning ticket will be issued on the first day or even in the first few\nhours. On the plus side, there’s also a reasonable chance the winner won’t pop\nup for a few weeks. Fortunately we believe there’s a fairly simple solution:\nclients can just deposit a multiple of the face value, thereby smoothing out the\nvariance. If we model this as a binomial distribution and if the client has $20\nin their account instead of $2, the chance of their balance being depleted twice\nas fast as expected is reduced from around 10% to about 2%.\n\nPayment Anonymity\nMost nanopayment tickets do not “win,” and therefore would not be posted\non-chain. However, rare winning tickets result in a public record on the\nEthereum blockchain. Therefore, Orchid nanopayments are only pseudo-anonymous.\nFor multi-hop circuits, it is anticipated that the Orchid client uses a separate\naccount for each hop, which helps prevent anyone tracing the circuit using\npublic payment information. As winning tickets are rare — anticipated to be\napproximately once per week in common circumstances — the public payment record\nfrom a multi-hop circuit is designed to appear essentially indistinguishable\nfrom that of a single-hop circuit. We expect that an adversary trying to trace\nthe route will learn some of the payment providers associated with a payer’s\npublic address, but the probability of two or more winning tickets to different\nnodes in the same circuit at the same time is vanishingly small, which reduces\nthe traceability of transactions.\n\nCensorship resistance\nAs on most public blockchain networks, Ethereum transactions cannot be censored\nunless their validators (miners in the Ethereum network) choose not to include\nthem in their created blocks. As blocks are mined randomly among all miners in\nproportion to hash power, the vast majority of miners would have to actively\ncensor Orchid payments to significantly disrupt the Orchid Network. For example,\nif 90% of the hash power chose not to include Orchid-related transactions, the\nOrchid Network would still function, albeit with transactions taking, on\naverage, ten times longer to confirm.\n\nA more severe form of censorship would be possible if a large group of miners —\nsay 51% — chose to censor Orchid-related transactions by rejecting blocks that\nincluded them. This would be valid according to the rules of the Ethereum\nprotocol, and would effectively create a soft fork. However, organizing\nlarge-scale miner collusion to create such a soft fork carries significant risk\nof financial loss for the colluders; if the soft fork fails to achieve\nsufficient hashing power, the colluding miners would miss out on their block\nrewards. Even without the risk of financial loss, we consider this possibility\nextremely unlikely due to the decentralized nature of Ethereum mining\ncommunities and the lack of legal and regulatory limitations on blockchain\nmining strategies.\n\nConclusion\nWe believe that Orchid nanopayments have advantages over existing payment\nchannel solutions and are optimized to provide a continuous service to users.\nThe reduction in transaction fees makes it possible to support up to millions of\nusers, without requiring any upgrades to Ethereum itself. Setup costs are not\npairwise, but are only incurred by the user to start. This means providers are\nexpected to be able to immediately begin servicing users without incurring setup\ncosts and users are expected to have the ability to switch between providers on\na whim, which we view as a design requirement for a modern-day VPN application.\n\nStay Up to date with Orchid\nIf you want to keep current on the latest Orchid news and be among the first to\ntest out the network and use the Orchid Token, sign up to our newsletter\n[https://www.orchid.com/#newsletter-signup] for launch updates.\n\nWebsite: www.orchid.com [http://www.orchid.com/]\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/OrchidProtocol\n\nLinkedin: https://www.linkedin.com/company/orchidprotocol/\n\nTelegram (Announcements): https://t.me/officialorchidlabs\n\nTelegram (Community): https://t.me/OrchidOfficial\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/OrchidProtocol/\n\nMedium: https://medium.com/orchid-labs\n\nGithub: https://github.com/OrchidProtocol\n\nReddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/orchid","html":"<p>When you wake up in the morning and flick on a light switch, do you pause to think about how many tiny fractions of a penny that electricity costs?

Finally, they leak payment information to more parties than stochastic payments. For these reasons, network payment channels are less practical than nanopayments for Orchid’s use case.</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><h2 id=\"orchidnanopaymentshowtheywork\">Orchid Nanopayments: how they work</h2>\n<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>Instead of sending a transaction worth $1 directly, with probabilistic payments the buyer could send a 1% chance of winning $100. Orchid’s design takes this to an extreme, with nanopayment tickets representing the value of thousandths of a penny, or smaller. The tickets are all sent off-chain; only when a winning ticket is redeemed would its receiver have to make an on-chain transaction to claim the face value amount, which is rare. The receiver has no way to know if a ticket is a winner beforehand, therefore giving all tickets implied value.</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><h2 id=\"theexpectedflowofnanopayments\">The expected flow of nanopayments</h2>\n<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><ul>\n<li>Sender opens nanopayment account by depositing OXT into an Ethereum smart contract.</li>\n<li>Sender can then issue valid nanopayments, backed by the deposit, to any provider on the network that is accepting payments for service.</li>\n<li>Eventually, the user is expected to issue a nanopayment that “wins”, which allows the provider to redeem the ticket as a payment via an on-chain transaction.</li>\n<li>The user may or may not need to add more OXT to their nanopayment account, depending on the level of funds in the account.</li>\n<li>Over time, the value transmitted on-chain will in expectation match the value represented in the probabilistic nanopayments.</li>\n</ul>\n<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><!--kg-card-begin: image--><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://blog.orchid.com/content/images/2019/11/image-5.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Nanopayments\"></figure><!--kg-card-end: image--><p>The graphic above demonstrates how the Orchid App users are expected to be able to send nanopayments to multiple providers after incurring a single deposit setup on the Ethereum blockchain, as well as how the general flow of payments is intended to operate.</p><p>We believe the general properties of this system are well suited for a bandwidth marketplace, where the user requires the ability to select different providers at will and for them to very quickly establish a payment-for-services relationship. Users should be able to quickly change VPN providers arbitrarily based on speed, availability, price and/or location. The setup of the nanopayment account on Ethereum is structured to be shouldered by the user, but is compatible with the current VPN market where users sign monthly, annual, or even multi-annual agreements with providers for VPN service. The Orchid user is expected to have the added benefit of being able to take back the deposit from the nanopayment account if they stop using the service.</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><h2 id=\"balancevariance\">Balance Variance</h2>\n<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>Orchid nanopayments do have one notable limitation: variance. Each time the Orchid App issues a nanopayment, there is a small independent probability of a winning ticket, which would decrease the receiver’s account balance. If the client’s balance was only large enough to cover a single winner, this would be a serious limitation. To illustrate this, imagine a client issuing tickets that have a 1-in-a-million chance of $2 at a rate of 1 million per week. While on average there will only be 1 winner per week, there is a reasonable probability that the winning ticket will be issued on the first day or even in the first few hours. On the plus side, there’s also a reasonable chance the winner won’t pop up for a few weeks. Fortunately we believe there’s a fairly simple solution: clients can just deposit a multiple of the face value, thereby smoothing out the variance. If we model this as a binomial distribution and if the client has $20 in their account instead of $2, the chance of their balance being depleted twice as fast as expected is reduced from around 10% to about 2%.</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><h2 id=\"paymentanonymity\">Payment Anonymity</h2>\n<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>Most nanopayment tickets do not “win,” and therefore would not be posted on-chain. However, rare winning tickets result in a public record on the Ethereum blockchain. Therefore, Orchid nanopayments are only pseudo-anonymous. For multi-hop circuits, it is anticipated that the Orchid client uses a separate account for each hop, which helps prevent anyone tracing the circuit using public payment information. As winning tickets are rare — anticipated to be approximately once per week in common circumstances — the public payment record from a multi-hop circuit is designed to appear essentially indistinguishable from that of a single-hop circuit. We expect that an adversary trying to trace the route will learn some of the payment providers associated with a payer’s public address, but the probability of two or more winning tickets to different nodes in the same circuit at the same time is vanishingly small, which reduces the traceability of transactions.</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><h2 id=\"censorshipresistance\">Censorship resistance</h2>\n<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>As on most public blockchain networks, Ethereum transactions cannot be censored unless their validators (miners in the Ethereum network) choose not to include them in their created blocks. As blocks are mined randomly among all miners in proportion to hash power, the vast majority of miners would have to actively censor Orchid payments to significantly disrupt the Orchid Network. For example, if 90% of the hash power chose not to include Orchid-related transactions, the Orchid Network would still function, albeit with transactions taking, on average, ten times longer to confirm.</p><p>A more severe form of censorship would be possible if a large group of miners — say 51% — chose to censor Orchid-related transactions by rejecting blocks that included them. This would be valid according to the rules of the Ethereum protocol, and would effectively create a soft fork. However, organizing large-scale miner collusion to create such a soft fork carries significant risk of financial loss for the colluders; if the soft fork fails to achieve sufficient hashing power, the colluding miners would miss out on their block rewards. Even without the risk of financial loss, we consider this possibility extremely unlikely due to the decentralized nature of Ethereum mining communities and the lack of legal and regulatory limitations on blockchain mining strategies.</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><h2 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h2>\n<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>We believe that Orchid nanopayments have advantages over existing payment channel solutions and are optimized to provide a continuous service to users. The reduction in transaction fees makes it possible to support up to millions of users, without requiring any upgrades to Ethereum itself. Setup costs are not pairwise, but are only incurred by the user to start. This means providers are expected to be able to immediately begin servicing users without incurring setup costs and users are expected to have the ability to switch between providers on a whim, which we view as a design requirement for a modern-day VPN application.</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><h2 id=\"stayuptodatewithorchid\">Stay Up to date with Orchid</h2>\n<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>If you want to keep current on the latest Orchid news and be among the first to test out the network and use the Orchid Token, <a href=\"https://www.orchid.com/#newsletter-signup\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">sign up to our newsletter</a> for launch updates.</p><p>Website: <a href=\"http://www.orchid.com/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">www.orchid.com</a></p><p>Twitter: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/OrchidProtocol\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">https://twitter.com/OrchidProtocol</a></p><p>Linkedin: <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/company/orchidprotocol/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">https://www.linkedin.com/company/orchidprotocol/</a></p><p>Telegram (Announcements): <a href=\"https://t.me/officialorchidlabs\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">https://t.me/officialorchidlabs</a></p><p>Telegram (Community): <a href=\"https://t.me/OrchidOfficial\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">https://t.me/OrchidOfficial</a></p><p>Facebook: <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/OrchidProtocol/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">https://www.facebook.com/OrchidProtocol/</a></p><p>Medium: <a href=\"https://medium.com/orchid-labs\" rel=\"noopener\">https://medium.com/orchid-labs</a></p><p>Github: <a href=\"https://github.com/OrchidProtocol\">https://github.com/OrchidProtocol</a></p><p>Reddit: <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/orchid\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">https://www.reddit.com/r/orchid</a></p>","url":"https://orchid-ghost-admin.circleclick.com/introducing-nanopayments/","uuid":"b77815e0-f652-4c72-aef3-d0d0823cb802","page":false,"codeinjection_foot":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_styles":null,"comment_id":"5dd46444c9410b04e25f76fe"}}]},"allGhostTag":{"edges":[{"node":{"slug":"vpn","name":"VPN","visibility":"public","feature_image":null,"description":null,"meta_title":null,"meta_description":null}},{"node":{"slug":"packet-sniffing","name":"Packet Sniffing","visibility":"public","feature_image":null,"description":null,"meta_title":null,"meta_description":null}},{"node":{"slug":"orchid-protocol","name":"Orchid Protocol","visibility":"public","feature_image":null,"description":null,"meta_title":null,"meta_description":null}},{"node":{"slug":"network-analysis","name":"Network Analysis","visibility":"public","feature_image":null,"description":null,"meta_title":null,"meta_description":null}},{"node":{"slug":"ethereum","name":"Ethereum","visibility":"public","feature_image":null,"description":null,"meta_title":null,"meta_description":null}},{"node":{"slug":"decentralization","name":"Decentralization","visibility":"public","feature_image":null,"description":null,"meta_title":null,"meta_description":null}},{"node":{"slug":"cryptocurrency","name":"Cryptocurrency","visibility":"public","feature_image":null,"description":null,"meta_title":null,"meta_description":null}},{"node":{"slug":"censorship","name":"Censorship","visibility":"public","feature_image":null,"description":null,"meta_title":null,"meta_description":null}},{"node":{"slug":"blockchain","name":"Blockchain","visibility":"public","feature_image":null,"description":null,"meta_title":null,"meta_description":null}}]}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"pageNumber":0,"humanPageNumber":1,"skip":0,"limit":12,"numberOfPages":1,"previousPagePath":"","nextPagePath":""}}}
