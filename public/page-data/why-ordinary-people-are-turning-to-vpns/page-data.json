Companies concerned with information security\n 2. Users concerned about privacy\n 3. People in countries where governments restricted access to information and\n    communication\n\nTwo decades after the advent of PPTP, the reasons why we use VPNs essentially\nhaven’t changed. What has changed is the number of internet users now utilizing\nVPNs. The number of VPN users is now climbing by tens of millions of people\neach\nyear [https://www.go-globe.com/blog/vpn-usage-statistics/], and that number is\nprojected to accelerate.\n\nWhat’s behind this acceleration? An increasing number of people are concerned\nabout their online privacy as data harvesting becomes more intrusive, more\ncomplete. And as internet use becomes intrinsically tied to our everyday lives,\nmore governments are moving to restrict the type of information that their\ncitizens can access.\n\nA decade ago, only a small percentage of internet users were utilizing VPNs.\nBecause of this, there was a sort of stigma—which still lingers today—around\nVPNs.\n\nThe desire for Privacy Is Normal, Not Suspicious\nTo some, particularly in the U.S., there’s an idea that the desire for online\nprivacy equates to a quest for anonymity in order to undertake illicit,\nnefarious activities. This narrative conjures images of the dark web. \n\nBut over the past few years, we’ve become aware of how pervasive online data\ncapturing is. And at the same time, we’ve seen how our personal data can be sold\nor compromised by third parties. Because of that, people who just a short while\nago were asking “Why would I need online privacy? I have nothing to hide,” are\nnow asking “How can I better protect myself?”\n\nConsider something as seemingly benign as looking up symptoms for a medical\ncondition online. 80% of Americans have searched health-related topics\n[http://www.nbcnews.com/id/3077086/t/more-people-search-health-online/#.XPGXZYhKiM9]\n, most without a second thought. What could go wrong? \n\nWhen you look up a medical symptom, like any other page you visit on the\ninternet, someone is capturing that data.

As more governments move to clamp down on communication\nand information, the notion of VPNs as simply a tool of activists or rebels\nfighting regimes is going away. In reality, most VPN users do so to access\nentertainment, messaging apps, news websites, and social media\n[https://thebestvpn.com/vpn-usage-statistics/]. \n\nIn this way, we can see that the vast majority of people using VPNs in countries\nwith repressive regimes are simply doing so in order to use the internet like\nanyone else. VPN usage isn’t nearly as radical in this sense as a government\ntrying to control every detail of information that its citizens can see. China\nrecently provided a good example of what this means. \n\nIn May, China moved to block all versions, in any language, of Wikipedia\n[https://slate.com/technology/2019/05/wikipedia-china-block-censorship-tiananmen-square.html]\n. The timing of which (like previous blocks of Wikipedia) coincides with the\nanniversary of the 1989 events at Tiananmen Square. It’s quintessentially\nOrwellian. In the dystopian masterpiece 1984, Orwell wrote, “Who controls the\npast controls the future: who controls the present controls the past.”\n\nAnd China is far from alone. Turkey has blocked all of Wikipedia since 2017 in\nthe name of “national security.” Iran consistently blocks articles it wants to\nhide from its citizens. \n\nThere’s something darkly unsettling about regimes so authoritarian that they try\nto hide the history of their recent past, shoveling it like dust into a rubbish\nbin, in order to try and gain support and control of the populace.
