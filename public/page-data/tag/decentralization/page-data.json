If you are a new\nreader, welcome! To get access to our upcoming Beta, sign up here\n[http://eepurl.com/dla1jH] to be the first to know when we go live. In the\nmeantime, feel free to drop into the Orchid Telegram Group\n[https://t.me/OrchidOfficial] to ask us a question.\n\nThe Orchid Vision\nOrchid Labs’ mission is to build open source software that keeps the Internet\nopen and accessible — a natural resource for everyone, everywhere.\n\nOur first step to fulfill that mission is to create a protocol that governs a\ndecentralized marketplace with a commodity specification for bandwidth. One key\nelement of the marketplace is a second layer payment solution, “Probabilistic\nMicropayments”, which adds transaction throughput and privacy to Ethereum.\nAnother is a Medallion system for bandwidth providers that grants the network\nSybil resistance and hardens it to other classes of attacks. More detail is laid\nout in our whitepaper [https://www.orchid.com/assets/whitepaper/whitepaper.pdf].\n\nThe first application that buys bandwidth on our marketplace will be the Orchid\nApp (coming soon to iOS and Android!). The Orchid App is an open source VPN\nclient with added security features, such as multi-hop routing. The goal with\nthe software is to provide secure access to the open Internet, right in line\nwith our mission. We also hope to play a part in driving the VPN market towards\nmore transparency, privacy and fairer pricing.\n\nOther applications can be built that harness the power of our protocol and\nbandwidth marketplace. The Orchid App will serve as a first example and we are\nexcited to discuss potential integrations. Email our team at partners@orchid.com\n[%22partners@orchid.com%22] to talk to us.\n\nAs we have been building over the past year, we continue to see concerning\ndevelopments across the globe as the Internet splinters and new forms of\ncommunication control are put into place. We believe that our contribution can\nhelp the world become openly connected.\n\nProgress in 2019\nThe year is flying by at Orchid and we’ve made considerable headway towards our\ngoals. Here are some of the highlights:\n\nFunding\n\nOrchid Labs announced that the company successfully raised $43 million in its\nlatest private offering to accredited investors. In total, Orchid Labs has\nraised $48 million to keep the Internet open and accessible. We are currently\nfocusing all effort on our upcoming Beta.\n\nProbabilistic Micropayments\n\nThe Orchid team originally laid out how Probabilistic Micropayments could work\non Ethereum in 2017, both in our whitepaper\n[https://www.orchid.com/assets/whitepaper/whitepaper.pdf] and in a blog post\n[https://medium.com/@gustav.simonsson/ethereum-probabilistic-micropayments-ae6e6cd85a06]\n. We are happy to report that we have an Etheruem smart contract implementation\nof Probabilistic Micropayments and we are currently integrating these into our\nclient and nodes for Beta.\n\nWe are also happy to see that other Ethereum projects are using our ideas as\nfuel and building their own implementations. Second layer payment solutions for\nspecific marketplaces can help scale the entire ecosystem and create products\nthat bring in more users.\n\nThe Orchid App\n\nThe Orchid App, our VPN client, is functioning on iOS and we have been testing\nthe application internally as well as demonstrating the mobile app in person\nduring conferences. The client is able to send packets to our nodes over\nmultiple hops, demonstrating a key feature that increases security and privacy.\n\nOrchid Node\n\nWe have an implementation functioning on Mac OS and Linux, relaying client\ntraffic over WebRTC and encrypted tunnels.\n\nNew Website Launch\n\nOrchid.comWe updated our brand and company narrative in February to something we\nbelieve frames what we are building in the correct light — a protected natural\nresource for everyone, everywhere.\n\nUpcoming Beta Release\nTo get access to our upcoming Beta, sign up here [http://eepurl.com/dla1jH] to\nbe the first to know when we go live.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThank you for your support.
