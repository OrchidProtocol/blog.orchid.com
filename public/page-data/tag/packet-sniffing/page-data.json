Once we launch our network, we can update the Orchid App to provide\ncomplete VPN service.\n\nIn its initial form, this app will only be focused on one thing: analyzing and\nreporting the hosts that the data on your device are connecting to. For now, our\napp includes the following features:\n\n * Local VPN service providing network flow analysis\n * Advanced filtering to drill down on the data you care about\n * IP address & port number for both source and destination\n\nIt’s important to us that this app is both open source and localized to your\ndevice, meaning no third parties see your data and nothing leaves your phone. We\nbelieve that an Open Source approach embraces the core tenets of\ndecentralization and provides the greatest opportunity to create a network\ncapable of delivering the stability, capacity, and security necessary to provide\nusers with the online experience they desire.\n\nWe continue to make progress on the Orchid Network and are finalizing our\nEthereum smart contracts ahead of internal audits. We’re excited to be able to\nrelease our app for iOS and Android now and get software into your hands.\n\nOur mission remains creating a suite of tools that provide privacy and access to\nreturn control and agency back into the hands of internet users.
