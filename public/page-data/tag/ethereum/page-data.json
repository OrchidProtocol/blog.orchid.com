But what users don’t know is that\nmany VPNs fail to provide the security and privacy that they advertise. It’s\ntime for a product that we can trust — a truly decentralized solution that will\ndeliver an open, inclusive internet free of censorship and data harvesting.\n\nIn much of the world, we’re now well into our third decade of online\nconnectivity. In Europe and North America, internet access is now nearly\nuniversal\n[https://datareportal.com/reports/digital-2019-global-digital-overview]. In\nother nations, the possibilities of an online world are just emerging. But as\naccess to the internet continues to expand around the globe, we’re seeing a\ntroubling pattern: an increasing desire on the part of state actors and big\ncorporations to own and control the internet.\n\nIt should come as no surprise that authoritarian regimes want to restrict the\ninternet. From their perspective, the availability of information on the\ninternet poses the greatest threat to control since the advent of the free\npress. As Ray Bradbury wrote in Fahrenheit 451, “If you don’t want a man unhappy\npolitically, don’t give him two sides to a question to worry him; give him one.\nBetter yet, give him none.”\n\nThis is the basic ethos of governments that embrace digital authoritarianism.\nAnd it goes well beyond stifling activists and dissidents. Under an\nauthoritarian regime, anyone — journalists, comedians, musicians, and ordinary\ncitizens — can be a target for daring to think differently or speaking out.\nThroughout the world, we see authoritarian governments attempting to control\nwhat types of information their citizens can access on the internet in an\nattempt to control their consciousness.\n\nIn other places — also fighting for control — we have a corporately controlled\ninternet. This model relies on the idea that in order to access information and\nconnect with others, you have to give up the right to your digital self.\n\nCorporate interests monitor and harvest our every contact and click, exploiting\nthe fact that we rely on the internet for nearly every facet of our lives. They\ndelve deep into our digital selves so that they can commodify our identities.\nFor years, they’ve succeeded with only a whisper of pushback. But recent\nscandals highlighting the dangers of this model have people paying attention.\n\nBy 2017, research and polling\n[http://www.telesign.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/TeleSign-Consumer-Account-Security-Report-2016-FINAL.pdf] \nshowed that Americans no longer trusted the widespread policy of corporate data\nharvesting:\n\n * 95% of Americans are concerned about how companies use their data\n * 80% are more concerned than they were a year ago\n * 50% are looking for new ways to safeguard their data\n\nThe desire for a better internet that allows us to communicate and collaborate\nwithout censorship or data exploitation is growing around the world. The pincer\nmovement being deployed by authoritarian and corporate interests has people\nlooking to escape these two failed models of the internet, and global citizens\nare increasingly turning towards technology that helps them regain control of\ntheir digital experiences. For many, the solution is the use of a virtual\nprivate network (VPN).\n\nThe Rise of the VPN\nIn their most basic sense, VPNs are intended to allow people to access the\ninternet without fear of tracking, censorship, or having their personal\ninformation compromised. Because of this, we’re seeing a massive rise in their\nuse.\n\nApproximately 25% of internet users in the world now use a VPN each month. And\nthat rise in users has led to a massive market to capitalize on user demand.\nIndustry reports show that the VPN market is growing by billions of dollars each\nyear, and is projected to more than triple, from $15.46 billion in 2016 to $54\nbillion by 2024.\n\nYoung people are a large reason for this projected increase; 68% of VPN users\nare under the age of 35. The reasons they’re using these services are relatable\nto anyone who has the internet. The primary reason people use a VPN is to access\nentertainment content; the secondary, to gain access to social networks and\nnews.\n\nAt its core, this increased usage should be a good thing. People around the\nworld are finding ways to circumvent the restrictive, exploitative nature of the\ncurrent internet. But the reliance on VPNs to help make a better internet relies\non one basic premise: complete trust in the company behind the VPN.\n\nAs the market for VPN services grows, consumers are presented with increasing\noptions. We have to ask ourselves: Do each of these services really offer us the\nsecurity and privacy that a VPN is meant to deliver? Sadly, the answer is no.\n\nWhy Current VPNs Can’t Solve Our Biggest Challenges\nThe problems go right to the core technology of most VPNs. Today, most VPNs rely\non a centralized system, and this structure is inherently impossible to trust.\nCentralized VPNs are susceptible to firewall blockages and often rely on\nremaining compliant with governments in order to operate. By their very nature,\nthey can’t provide the user with the benefits desired.\n\nFor VPN users in nations with regimes attempting to control the flow of news and\ninformation, governments heavily regulate the VPN industry. Operating within\nmany nations means that a VPN provider has to register or get licensed with the\ngovernment. How is it possible to trust a VPN approved by a government\nattempting to control and monitor online traffic? For instance, roughly 60% of\nthe top, free VPN services are based in China. Do we have faith that the Chinese\ngovernment is allowing the services to operate without monitoring user behavior?\n\nIn nations where the population enjoys unfettered access to news and\ninformation, another threat arises — a lack of transparency on the part of VPN\nproviders. In a study of the world’s 115 most popular VPNs, 26 were found to be\nkeeping tabs on their users. While marketing language may argue otherwise, the\nbusiness model for many free VPNs is based on the provider harvesting and\nselling the users’ personal data. Buried in that fine print at the bottom of the\nterms and conditions is the acquiescence of consent.\n\nSold as a way to ensure private, secure browsing, the companies behind VPNs are\nactually tracking user data related to bandwidth, connection timestamps, IP\naddresses, and websites visited. Users who rely on services like this are often\nunaware they are being monitored and tracked. We’re left asking: To whom is the\ndata sold to and for what purpose?\n\nIn other words, while internet users are attempting to gain access free of\ncensorship and personal data mining, the services they use to do that are\ncompounding the issue by exploiting their trust. At the heart of this problem is\nthe issue of centralization. A centralized system requires complete trust on the\npart of the user, and with complete trust comes the ability to exploit it.\n\nSecurity and protection pose additional threats. The vast majority of VPNs rely\non single-hop service, which allows interested parties to discover both where\ntraffic is coming from and where it is going. Traditional VPN traffic also\nleaves a signature that is relatively easy to spot. For users in countries where\nattempting to access a news website, like the BBC, or a social network, like\nFacebook, presents the threat of imprisonment, this is a very real danger.\n\nWhile there have been genuine attempts to alleviate the above issues via the use\nof decentralized VPNs, the attempts thus far have fallen short. VPNs featuring\nthe use of decentralized servers have relied on a system of volunteers to act as\nnodes to power the system. While these services have gained some traction, the\nlack of volunteers has led to systems that lack the bandwidth, computational\ncapacity, and servers to create a truly secure, private online experience.\n\nBuilding a Better VPN\nAs people around the world migrate towards VPNs, the need for a truly\ndecentralized system with the capacity to provide everyone on Earth access to\nnews, entertainment, and communication is increasingly evident.\n\nOver the past year at Orchid, we’ve had our heads down, working to develop a new\nonline experience which delivers to everyone — regardless of geographic location\nor political reality — the internet they deserve: secure, unrestricted access to\ninformation and connectivity free of monitoring and data harvesting.\n\nThe world deserves a better internet. At Orchid, we believe that a decentralized\nsolution that eliminates the possibility of authoritarian or corporate control\ncan help provide it. If you believe that everyone on Earth should be able to\naccess the internet and enjoy an online experience free of repression and\nexploitation, we hope you’ll join us as we work towards that.","html":"<p>As dueling interests move to control the future of the internet, users around the globe are increasingly turning to VPNs.
