The viable\ndefenses against systemic attacks in an open decentralized system are ultimately\neconomic — a system is secure to the extent that the cost of an attack to an\nattacker outweighs the benefits to that attacker, or is too costly to execute\nregardless. Decentralized systems use these security parameters to secure their\nnetworks and provide incentives by which miners or participants can earn in\nreturn. Most open blockchains today use one of two models: proof-of-work, which\nrequires electricity; or proof-of-stake, which requires coordination efforts and\ngovernance. The Orchid Network is expected to use a derivative of\nproof-of-stake, called stake weighting, to authenticate peer-to-peer bandwidth\nagreements combined with Ethereum’s consensus to settle transactions.\n\nThis means that bandwidth providers stake Orchid cryptocurrency for commercial\nuse on the Orchid Network (OXT) in time-locked deposits to prove identity and\nreceive traffic in proportion to relative stake deposit size. We evolved our\ndesign to use stake-weighting after originally considering using proof-of-work,\nwhich is described in our original white paper as Medallions. We moved away from\nthat system because:\n\n * Proof-of-work creates an additional compute burden on end users\n * Proof-of-work has far lower attack costs than stake-weighting with delay,\n   even assuming rental markets\n * General compute rental markets already exist with far more relative liquidity\n   than we expect will exist in any future OXT stake deposit rental markets\n\nThe Orchid Network\nThe Orchid Network is designed to be a set of data structures stored on the\nEthereum blockchain that allows clients to efficiently select bandwidth sellers’\nnodes. Essentially, it forms a simple Orchid-specific overlay on the Ethereum\nnetwork.\n\nAt a high level, the Orchid Network is expected to provide the following key\noperations:\n\n * A means for bandwidth providers to register their nodes via staking\n * A method for bandwidth providers to register custom services and metadata\n * A means for clients to query nodes for custom services and metadata\n * A method for selecting a random node, with probability proportional to stake\n\nThe use of stake-weighting is intended to allow the economic security of the\nOrchid Network to scale linearly with the size of the total deposited stake. The\nstake-weighted selection process itself is implemented using an on-chain tree\ndata structure, which is intended to allow a client to outsource the selection\nof nodes to other nodes in a scalable trustless manner, avoiding the need for\nlightweight clients to ever download, store, or process the complete node\ndirectory.\n\nNode directory tree\nTo implement the scan function efficiently, we use an on-chain binary weighted\ntree data structure. Each node in the tree is expected to be a stake entry,\nwhich stores a stakee, an amount, and a delay, in addition to the tree pointers\nand stake subtotals for the left and right subtrees. This structure effectively\nforms a prefix sum tree over all the stake deposits, allowing a simple descent\ndecision at each node to find the subtree (or internode) containing a given\nrandom point; finding the exact node containing the given random point is\nexpected to require only a logarithmic number of steps.\n\nNode metadata registry\nThe Node metadata registry is anticipated to allow providers to ‘tag’ nodes with\nmetadata. Bandwidth providers can use this to store custom metadata associated\nwith their nodes on the blockchain and advertise services. The metadata registry\nis structured to be generic in order to enable a simple means for future custom\nextensions. This is intended to allow node operators to advertise new services,\nwhich clients can then select for without code updates.\n\nOrchid App users interested in filtering service based on certain criteria, such\nas geography, are expected to be able to use tags to do so. Since tags are\npieces of metadata added by providers, ultimately the Orchid App must check\nwhether the provider is acting honestly. In many cases, we expect the checks\nwill be automated.\n\nExamples of Metadata Tags:\n\n * Geolocation: Providers are expected to be able to advertise their service in\n   a particular region so that clients can filter based on location (similar to\n   a typical VPN service). The Orchid App will use a public IP database to\n   confirm the location.\n * Latency: In some cases users will desire connections with lower latency than\n   randomly chosen nodes. The Orchid App is designed to employ a\n   ‘guess-and-check’ strategy by using the same public IP database to find\n   routes with a shorter distance. Ultimately, the actual latency must be\n   measured once a route is constructed. If the latency is higher than the\n   target threshold, we expect that a new, different route must be sampled. The\n   lightweight nature of Orchid routes and nanopayments is anticipated to allow\n   for fast route setup and parallel route testing.\n * Price: Providers are anticipated to set their bandwidth prices and the client\n   can filter on price. The Orchid App intends to use a budgeting algorithm to\n   determine a current spending cap based on the user’s balance and a target\n   timespan representing how long the budget should last.\n\nCurated lists\nThe Orchid App is designed to also filter based on arbitrary exit or relay node\nlists, which limits the viable nodes to a custom subset. Initial releases of the\nofficial Orchid App is expected to use this feature to prevent certain kinds of\nattacks from malicious exit nodes (e.g. SSL downgrade attacks) by using a\ndefault exit node list consisting of trusted VPN partners. Customized Orchid\nclients can use their own lists, and eventually we expect well known third\nparties to emerge as whitelist curators. Curated lists are a simple means for\nthe importation of external reputational trust to supplement the economic,\nincentive-based trust provided by staking.\n\nHow to sell bandwidth on Orchid\nThe Orchid Market uses a decentralized architecture to connect users to\nbandwidth providers via tokenized, peer-to-peer commercial nano-transactions.\n\nTo sell bandwidth, providers register nodes on the Ethereum blockchain, which\nclients select through calls to Ethereum smart contracts. The user running the\nOrchid App then initiates proxy chain connections, which connect through one or\nmore relay nodes before an exit node to their destination. Clients are expected\nto pay bandwidth providers to forward packets using probabilistic nanopayments.\nOccasionally the seller is expected to receive a winning nanopayment ticket\nwhich they redeem for Orchid Tokens (OXT) through a smart contract function\ncall.\n\nA requirement for registering a node in the Orchid Network is to stake OXT. The\nsize of the stake is crucial for the stake-weighted selection and the more OXT\nthat is staked, the greater the probability that the provider will receive\nrequests for traffic from the Orchid App users.\n\nWe anticipate that there are three steps to earning as a Node operator:\n\n * Acquire OXT: Buy OXT tokens from an exchange or recieve OXT in a wallet\n   through transfer, or earn OXT by registering as a node provider.\n * Stake OXT: Deposit OXT tokens into the node directory contract\n * Provide: Sell services to the Orchid App users\n * Payment: Receive OXT payment for services in a provider controlled wallet\n\nUser stake deposit\nFor Orchid App users to join the network, they must have a valid deposit in the\nnanopayment smart contract in order to issue tickets to a provider in exchange\nfor bandwidth. A small portion of this deposit is intended to be held in escrow\nas a user “stake” to align their incentives with that of the network as a whole.\n\nHow nodes are selected\nApps are expected to select nodes for proxy chains using a two-step process of\nrandom relative stake-weighted linear selection followed by secondary constraint\nfiltering. The first stage linear selection is designed to be performed by the\nscan function on the node directory tree. The App generates a random point\nlocally and passes it on as the single argument to scan, which then descends\ndown the node directory tree. The search terminates in the single unique leaf —\nor internode — whose stake segment intersects the chosen random point.\n\nUsing a smart contract to implement the main node scan function allows the\nselection process to be easily outsourced to server nodes. A client requests one\nor more scan calls and a remote server node executes each scan locally and send\nback simple proofs of the execution trace.\n\nAfter selecting one or more nodes based on linear relative stake weighting, it\nis designed such that the client can then filter by additional criteria such as\nexit location, latency (ping), price, custom node metadata tags, and arbitrary\nwhitelists.\n\nStake withdrawal delay\nOrchid stake deposits can not be withdrawn immediately; they are subject to an\nintentional withdrawal delay limitation. The withdrawal delay is an important\nsecurity restriction. It creates an obstacle for attackers attempting to acquire\na large portion of Orchid App connection requests. In particular, it helps\nprevent a systemic takeover attack. This is an attack in which an adversary\nacquires a large fraction of the total deposit stake and then directs clients to\nmalicious servers, which provide intentionally poor connections, log and report\ntraffic, or attempt active connection attacks (e.g. SSL downgrades).\n\nWe believe the main defense against systemic takeover attacks is the high cost\nbarrier to acquiring and locking up a significant fraction of the total OXT\nstake. Without a withdrawal delay, this barrier becomes simply an issue of\naccess to sufficient liquidity, with little actual net cost to an attack.\n\nA sufficiently long withdrawal delay is more likely to create an additional loss\nfor the attacker when they finally end the attack and sell their large OXT\nposition. The App software then filters based on withdrawal delay, ignoring\nstake deposits with delays that do not meet the App threshold. Orchid’s initial\nApp software will accept withdrawal delays of three months or greater, but the\nflexible parameterization allows future App updates to change this parameter\nwithout the equivalent of a hard fork and associated coordination difficulties.\n\nConclusion\nBy adopting a stake-weighting approach to disincentivize attacks and creating an\nincentivized marketplace backed by the Orchid Token, we’re one step closer to\nachieving our ultimate goal: making the Internet a more open, inclusive space\nfor users around the world. Whether you want to purchase or sell resources using\nthe Orchid, the Orchid Network is designed to give users private and secure\naccess to the internet, regardless of geographic location.

This\npeer-to-peer marketplace is dynamic; clients can select single- or multi-hop\nonion routed circuits by selecting nodes randomly weighted on stake and filtered\non secondary desiderata (price, location, etc.). A single hop route has the\nbenefits of a normal VPN connection, creating a tunnel to route your traffic\nover a public network or your ISP, while a multi-hop connection provides\nadditional privacy benefits by securing your network data from any one provider.\n\nTraditional VPNs today are limited; the centralized nature of their offering\ncannot compete with the distributed properties of combining multiple different\nproviders to offer multi-hop level security. And even if a single company offers\nmultiple hop VPN routes, there is still a single centralized entity you are\nplacing your trust into. Using a distributed system allows you, as a user, to\ndistribute trust across multiple distinct VPN providers, thereby breaking apart\nthe flow of your information so no single entity can see the entire picture.\nSuch a system is not possible when purchasing a VPN service from a single\nprovider.\n\nStaking aligns incentives against operator malfeasance, and linear stake\nweighting in particular neutralizes sybil attacks. A stochastic nanopayment\nsolution scales transaction throughput, enabling a highly liquid bandwidth\nmarket without a trusted central party. Nanopayments on the scale of packets\nallow high frequency, trustless interactions by reducing the implicit floated\nbalances between transactors to miniscule levels.\n\nCore Technology\nOrchid’s technology is highly modular. Each component is intended to be somewhat\nseparable, and to interact well with a particular role in the larger ecosystem.\nAbstractly, the system involves:\n\n * Users who run the Orchid App\n * Service providers who run the Orchid Server\n * A protocol that intermediates client/server interactions\n * Several smart contracts deployed to the Ethereum blockchain that support the\n   economically sound and technically secure operation of the protocols\n\nIn pursuit of security, we have tended to remove features and design elements\nthat we did not think would continue to function basically “as is” for many\nyears.\n\nOrchid Cryptocurrency (OXT)\nOXT is expected to be a “pre-mined” cryptocurrency based on the ERC-20 standard\nthat will be used to decentralize trust between buyers and sellers in the Orchid\nmarketplace. It also functions as a tool to promote security and healthy market\ndynamics, as providers can adjust their OXT stake to remain competitive. At\nlaunch we intend there to be a limited supply of one billion (1,000,000,000). We\ndo not intend ever to create any additional OXT.\n\nOrchid Protocol\nThe Orchid software is designed to use a custom VPN protocol, similar in scope\nto OpenVPN or WireGuard. The Orchid protocol is designed for high-performance\nnetworking and runs on top of WebRTC, a common web standard, widely used to\ntransmit video and audio from inside browsers. Our protocol is intended to allow\nusers to request access to remote network resources and pay for these resources\nusing OXT via a nanopayments system.\n\nOrchid Server Design\nService providers on Orchid are anticipated to run a server similar to a typical\nVPN daemon for protocols such as OpenVPN, but which speaks the Orchid protocol.\nOrchid servers maintain registration information in a stake registry and\nprovider directory. The stake registry is optimized to enable the Orchid client\nto automatically discover random servers on behalf of users in a decentralized\nenvironment, while the provider directory allows server nodes to register\nmetadata such as geolocation or additional services offered. Collectively, the\nOrchid Servers make up the Network.\n\nThe Orchid Network Design\nOrchid uses a set of data structures stored on the Ethereum blockchain that\nallows clients to efficiently select bandwidth-sellers’ nodes.\n\nClients are expected to select nodes for proxy chains using a two-step process\nof random relative stake-weighted linear selection, followed by secondary\nconstraint filtering. The first stage linear selection is performed by the scan\nfunction on the node directory tree. The App generates a random point locally\nand passes it in as the single argument to scan, which then descends down the\nnode directory tree. The search terminates in the single unique leaf, or\ninternode, whose stake segment intersects the chosen random point.\n\nAfter selecting one or more nodes based on linear relative stake weighting, the\napp can then filter by additional criteria such as exit geolocation, latency\n(ping), price, custom node metadata tags, and arbitrary whitelists.\n\nOrchid’s Network: Random Selection + Stake Weighting\n[/orchids-network-random-selection-stake-weighting/]\n\nThe Orchid App Design\nThe Orchid App is a client similar to a typical VPN client for protocols such as\nOpenVPN, but which speaks the Orchid protocol. The Orchid network client is\nintended to go past the basic functionality offered by most VPN clients, with\nfeatures such as the ability to analyze network traffic and to pick multiple\nproviders in a multi-hop configuration. The Orchid client is accessible via iOS,\nAndroid, macOS, Linux, and (soon) Windows.\n\nOrchid Nanopayments Design\nOrchid’s structure uses a new probabilistic nanopayment system designed to allow\nthe system to scale to potentially millions of transactions per second, enabling\ndecentralized payments on a per-packet basis. This nanopayment system is the\nfoundation of the Orchid peer-to-peer bandwidth marketplace where clients pay\nNode operators OXT lottery tickets for proxy bandwidth. The system is designed\nto lower the transaction costs for small payments by amortizing transaction fees\nacross many transactions and even across multiple parties.\n\nSee Introducing Nanopayments [/introducing-nanopayments/] for more details.\n\nThe Orchid Marketplace\nThe Orchid Market is a decentralized peer-to-peer (P2P) network, which allows\nusers running the Orchid App to purchase bandwidth from one or more sellers\nrunning the Orchid server in order to form a proxy chain to a specific resource\non the Internet (such as a website).\n\nThe main participant roles in the Orchid Market are:\n\n * A user running the Orchid App who initiates proxy chain connections\n * One or more relay nodes who forward encrypted traffic (optionally)\n * An exit node who provides the final connection to an external destination\n   (e.g., a website)\n * A bandwidth seller who accepts nanopayments for traffic (either a relay or\n   exit)\n\nBandwidth sellers register their nodes on the Ethereum blockchain and user\nclients select suitable nodes for routes through calls to Ethereum smart\ncontracts. Orchid’s structure uses stake-weighting: sellers lock up OXT\ncryptocurrency to form stake deposits associated with their nodes in order to\nreceive traffic in proportion to their relative stake.\n\nConclusion\nThe various components described above collectively form Orchid. When we put the\npieces together, we are in the process of creating a new VPN product that\nharnesses the nature of decentralization to distribute trust across multiple\nproviders and ultimately give the user far more agency and control than is\navailable on the current market. By combining a decentralized design with a\nmarket-based incentive structure, we believe that users can protect their\nprivacy and control their data while creating demand to support a healthy\nmarketplace.\n\nWe anticipate in the future that the open source community developing on our\nprotocol will be working on solutions for traffic analysis resistance, payment\nanonymity, low-variance nanopayments, improved double-spend detection and\nprevention, traffic obfuscation, improved censorship resistance, whitelist\nsurety bonds, and more.\n\nAs both governments and corporations attempt to control our online interactions,\nthe VPN market is skyrocketing. But in order to achieve what users desire in a\nVPN service, we need a new model. At Orchid, we think that a peer-to-peer\nmarketplace and decentralized architecture on the Ethereum blockchain can help\npave the way for a new era of online interaction, where individuals, not\norganizations, control the future.\n\nStay Up to date with Orchid\nIf you want to keep current on the latest Orchid news and be among the first to\ntest out the network, sign up for our newsletter\n[https://www.orchid.com/#newsletter-signup] to receive launch updates.\n\nWebsite: www.orchid.com [http://www.orchid.com/]\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/OrchidProtocol\n\nLinkedin: https://www.linkedin.com/company/orchidprotocol/\n\nTelegram (Announcements): https://t.me/officialorchidlabs\n\nTelegram (Community): https://t.me/OrchidOfficial\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/OrchidProtocol/\n\nMedium: https://medium.com/orchid-labs\n\nGithub: https://github.com/OrchidProtocol\n\nReddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/orchid","html":"<p>Orchid is a decentralized, market-based system for anonymous communication and virtual private networking, including a bandwidth market where node providers stake tokens to advertise their services using the Ethereum blockchain and receive payment in OXT (Orchid’s native cryptocurrency).</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><blockquote>\n<p>Using a distributed system allows you, as a user, to distribute trust across multiple distinct VPN providers, thereby breaking apart the flow of your information so no single entity can see the entire picture.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>In the Orchid marketplace, incentives are used to create economic security and reliability between clients and servers in a permissionless way. This peer-to-peer marketplace is dynamic; clients can select single- or multi-hop onion routed circuits by selecting nodes randomly weighted on stake and filtered on secondary desiderata (price, location, etc.). A single hop route has the benefits of a normal VPN connection, creating a tunnel to route your traffic over a public network or your ISP, while a multi-hop connection provides additional privacy benefits by securing your network data from any one provider.</p><p>Traditional VPNs today are limited; the centralized nature of their offering cannot compete with the distributed properties of combining multiple different providers to offer multi-hop level security. And even if a single company offers multiple hop VPN routes, there is still a single centralized entity you are placing your trust into.

In Europe and North America, internet access is now nearly\nuniversal\n[https://datareportal.com/reports/digital-2019-global-digital-overview]. In\nother nations, the possibilities of an online world are just emerging. But as\naccess to the internet continues to expand around the globe, we’re seeing a\ntroubling pattern: an increasing desire on the part of state actors and big\ncorporations to own and control the internet.\n\nIt should come as no surprise that authoritarian regimes want to restrict the\ninternet. From their perspective, the availability of information on the\ninternet poses the greatest threat to control since the advent of the free\npress. As Ray Bradbury wrote in Fahrenheit 451, “If you don’t want a man unhappy\npolitically, don’t give him two sides to a question to worry him; give him one.\nBetter yet, give him none.”\n\nThis is the basic ethos of governments that embrace digital authoritarianism.\nAnd it goes well beyond stifling activists and dissidents.

They\ndelve deep into our digital selves so that they can commodify our identities.\nFor years, they’ve succeeded with only a whisper of pushback. But recent\nscandals highlighting the dangers of this model have people paying attention.\n\nBy 2017, research and polling\n[http://www.telesign.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/TeleSign-Consumer-Account-Security-Report-2016-FINAL.pdf] \nshowed that Americans no longer trusted the widespread policy of corporate data\nharvesting:\n\n * 95% of Americans are concerned about how companies use their data\n * 80% are more concerned than they were a year ago\n * 50% are looking for new ways to safeguard their data\n\nThe desire for a better internet that allows us to communicate and collaborate\nwithout censorship or data exploitation is growing around the world. The pincer\nmovement being deployed by authoritarian and corporate interests has people\nlooking to escape these two failed models of the internet, and global citizens\nare increasingly turning towards technology that helps them regain control of\ntheir digital experiences. For many, the solution is the use of a virtual\nprivate network (VPN).\n\nThe Rise of the VPN\nIn their most basic sense, VPNs are intended to allow people to access the\ninternet without fear of tracking, censorship, or having their personal\ninformation compromised. Because of this, we’re seeing a massive rise in their\nuse.\n\nApproximately 25% of internet users in the world now use a VPN each month. And\nthat rise in users has led to a massive market to capitalize on user demand.\nIndustry reports show that the VPN market is growing by billions of dollars each\nyear, and is projected to more than triple, from $15.46 billion in 2016 to $54\nbillion by 2024.\n\nYoung people are a large reason for this projected increase; 68% of VPN users\nare under the age of 35. The reasons they’re using these services are relatable\nto anyone who has the internet. The primary reason people use a VPN is to access\nentertainment content; the secondary, to gain access to social networks and\nnews.\n\nAt its core, this increased usage should be a good thing. People around the\nworld are finding ways to circumvent the restrictive, exploitative nature of the\ncurrent internet. But the reliance on VPNs to help make a better internet relies\non one basic premise: complete trust in the company behind the VPN.\n\nAs the market for VPN services grows, consumers are presented with increasing\noptions. We have to ask ourselves: Do each of these services really offer us the\nsecurity and privacy that a VPN is meant to deliver? Sadly, the answer is no.\n\nWhy Current VPNs Can’t Solve Our Biggest Challenges\nThe problems go right to the core technology of most VPNs. Today, most VPNs rely\non a centralized system, and this structure is inherently impossible to trust.\nCentralized VPNs are susceptible to firewall blockages and often rely on\nremaining compliant with governments in order to operate. By their very nature,\nthey can’t provide the user with the benefits desired.\n\nFor VPN users in nations with regimes attempting to control the flow of news and\ninformation, governments heavily regulate the VPN industry. Operating within\nmany nations means that a VPN provider has to register or get licensed with the\ngovernment. How is it possible to trust a VPN approved by a government\nattempting to control and monitor online traffic? For instance, roughly 60% of\nthe top, free VPN services are based in China. Do we have faith that the Chinese\ngovernment is allowing the services to operate without monitoring user behavior?\n\nIn nations where the population enjoys unfettered access to news and\ninformation, another threat arises — a lack of transparency on the part of VPN\nproviders. In a study of the world’s 115 most popular VPNs, 26 were found to be\nkeeping tabs on their users. While marketing language may argue otherwise, the\nbusiness model for many free VPNs is based on the provider harvesting and\nselling the users’ personal data. Buried in that fine print at the bottom of the\nterms and conditions is the acquiescence of consent.\n\nSold as a way to ensure private, secure browsing, the companies behind VPNs are\nactually tracking user data related to bandwidth, connection timestamps, IP\naddresses, and websites visited. Users who rely on services like this are often\nunaware they are being monitored and tracked. We’re left asking: To whom is the\ndata sold to and for what purpose?\n\nIn other words, while internet users are attempting to gain access free of\ncensorship and personal data mining, the services they use to do that are\ncompounding the issue by exploiting their trust. At the heart of this problem is\nthe issue of centralization. A centralized system requires complete trust on the\npart of the user, and with complete trust comes the ability to exploit it.\n\nSecurity and protection pose additional threats. The vast majority of VPNs rely\non single-hop service, which allows interested parties to discover both where\ntraffic is coming from and where it is going. Traditional VPN traffic also\nleaves a signature that is relatively easy to spot. For users in countries where\nattempting to access a news website, like the BBC, or a social network, like\nFacebook, presents the threat of imprisonment, this is a very real danger.\n\nWhile there have been genuine attempts to alleviate the above issues via the use\nof decentralized VPNs, the attempts thus far have fallen short. VPNs featuring\nthe use of decentralized servers have relied on a system of volunteers to act as\nnodes to power the system. While these services have gained some traction, the\nlack of volunteers has led to systems that lack the bandwidth, computational\ncapacity, and servers to create a truly secure, private online experience.\n\nBuilding a Better VPN\nAs people around the world migrate towards VPNs, the need for a truly\ndecentralized system with the capacity to provide everyone on Earth access to\nnews, entertainment, and communication is increasingly evident.\n\nOver the past year at Orchid, we’ve had our heads down, working to develop a new\nonline experience which delivers to everyone — regardless of geographic location\nor political reality — the internet they deserve: secure, unrestricted access to\ninformation and connectivity free of monitoring and data harvesting.\n\nThe world deserves a better internet. At Orchid, we believe that a decentralized\nsolution that eliminates the possibility of authoritarian or corporate control\ncan help provide it. If you believe that everyone on Earth should be able to\naccess the internet and enjoy an online experience free of repression and\nexploitation, we hope you’ll join us as we work towards that.","html":"<p>As dueling interests move to control the future of the internet, users around the globe are increasingly turning to VPNs.

And that rise in users has led to a massive market to capitalize on user demand. Industry reports show that the VPN market is growing by billions of dollars each year, and is projected to more than triple, from $15.46 billion in 2016 to $54 billion by 2024.</p><p>Young people are a large reason for this projected increase; 68% of VPN users are under the age of 35. The reasons they’re using these services are relatable to anyone who has the internet. The primary reason people use a VPN is to access entertainment content; the secondary, to gain access to social networks and news.</p><p>At its core, this increased usage should be a good thing. People around the world are finding ways to circumvent the restrictive, exploitative nature of the current internet. But the reliance on VPNs to help make a better internet relies on one basic premise: complete trust in the company behind the VPN.</p><p>As the market for VPN services grows, consumers are presented with increasing options. We have to ask ourselves: Do each of these services really offer us the security and privacy that a VPN is meant to deliver? Sadly, the answer is no.</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><h2 id=\"whycurrentvpnscantsolveourbiggestchallenges\">Why Current VPNs Can’t Solve Our Biggest Challenges</h2>\n<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>The problems go right to the core technology of most VPNs. Today, most VPNs rely on a centralized system, and this structure is inherently impossible to trust. Centralized VPNs are susceptible to firewall blockages and often rely on remaining compliant with governments in order to operate. By their very nature, they can’t provide the user with the benefits desired.</p><p>For VPN users in nations with regimes attempting to control the flow of news and information, governments heavily regulate the VPN industry. Operating within many nations means that a VPN provider has to register or get licensed with the government. How is it possible to trust a VPN approved by a government attempting to control and monitor online traffic? For instance, roughly 60% of the top, free VPN services are based in China. Do we have faith that the Chinese government is allowing the services to operate without monitoring user behavior?</p><p>In nations where the population enjoys unfettered access to news and information, another threat arises — a lack of transparency on the part of VPN providers. In a study of the world’s 115 most popular VPNs, 26 were found to be keeping tabs on their users. While marketing language may argue otherwise, the business model for many free VPNs is based on the provider harvesting and selling the users’ personal data. Buried in that fine print at the bottom of the terms and conditions is the acquiescence of consent.</p><!--kg-card-begin: image--><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"/content/images/2019/10/0_DOEy9TgdGBuFcLqq.png\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><!--kg-card-end: image--><p>Sold as a way to ensure private, secure browsing, the companies behind VPNs are actually tracking user data related to bandwidth, connection timestamps, IP addresses, and websites visited. Users who rely on services like this are often unaware they are being monitored and tracked. We’re left asking: To whom is the data sold to and for what purpose?</p><p>In other words, while internet users are attempting to gain access free of censorship and personal data mining, the services they use to do that are compounding the issue by exploiting their trust. At the heart of this problem is the issue of centralization. A centralized system requires complete trust on the part of the user, and with complete trust comes the ability to exploit it.</p><p>Security and protection pose additional threats. The vast majority of VPNs rely on single-hop service, which allows interested parties to discover both where traffic is coming from and where it is going. Traditional VPN traffic also leaves a signature that is relatively easy to spot. For users in countries where attempting to access a news website, like the BBC, or a social network, like Facebook, presents the threat of imprisonment, this is a very real danger.</p><p>While there have been genuine attempts to alleviate the above issues via the use of decentralized VPNs, the attempts thus far have fallen short. VPNs featuring the use of decentralized servers have relied on a system of volunteers to act as nodes to power the system. While these services have gained some traction, the lack of volunteers has led to systems that lack the bandwidth, computational capacity, and servers to create a truly secure, private online experience.</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><h2 id=\"buildingabettervpn\">Building a Better VPN</h2>\n<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>As people around the world migrate towards VPNs, the need for a truly decentralized system with the capacity to provide everyone on Earth access to news, entertainment, and communication is increasingly evident.</p><p>Over the past year at Orchid, we’ve had our heads down, working to develop a new online experience which delivers to everyone — regardless of geographic location or political reality — the internet they deserve: secure, unrestricted access to information and connectivity free of monitoring and data harvesting.</p><p>The world deserves a better internet.
