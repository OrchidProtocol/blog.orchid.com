At Orchid Labs\n[http://www.orchidprotocol.com/], our goal is to ensure that every person on\nEarth can have access to an open, decentralized, and uncensored Internet. We\nbelieve a better Internet is one that isn’t controlled by the few, but open to\nall.\n\nCurrently, Internet access for the majority of the people on Earth is censored\nand monitored. Because of this, many Internet users are blocked from freely\ncommunicating, collaborating, and accessing information. The current centralized\nsystem, which limits our ability to communicate and learn — while also\nharvesting and selling our personal data — is far from the full potential of\nwhat the internet could be and strays from the original intention of its\ncreators.\n\nThat’s why we’ve launched the Orchid Protocol, an open-source overlay network\nthat uses excess bandwidth on top of the existing Internet to ensure that people\n— no matter where they live on our planet — can have unrestricted access to\ninformation and collaboration. Orchid’s protocol combines surplus bandwidth,\nstate-of-the-art encryption, and a decentralized infrastructure enabling any\nInternet user to participate and exchange bandwidth for payment in peer-to-peer\ntransactions using Orchid tokens on the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nOur team consists of engineers, cryptocurrency experts, technologists, and\npartners dedicated to creating an Internet free of surveillance and censorship.\nThis idea isn’t new; there are people across the globe dedicated to this cause.\nWe believe the Orchid Protocol will help the world finally create this reality.\n\nWhile I’ve been interested in the idea of Internet freedom for some time, the\norigins of Orchid stem from conversations with Steve Bell, an entrepreneur with\nmore than a decade of experience backing Chinese seed stage startups. We had\nboth personally experienced and witnessed the consequences of surveillance and\ncensorship in our work across the world. My concern was one of surveillance,\nwhile Steve’s was one of censorship or access. My perspective was, “how do\ncommunicate or access information in a potentially totalitarian state in a\nprivate fashion”. I had also experience security issues first hand, both during\nthe Bitstamp hack of 2015\n[https://techcrunch.com/2015/01/05/bitstamp-bitcoin-exchange-hack/] and in\nhaving my own phone ported\n[https://medium.com/@stevewaterhouse/notes-on-recovering-from-a-hack-3cd438e10fe0]\n.\n\nWe started discussing ways to create an internet free of surveillance and\ncensorship that everyone in the world could access. With a passion for where we\nwanted to go and a firm idea of how to get there, we knew we needed the\ntechnological expertise and funding to make this happen.\n\nFortunately, we’ve met many technologists and partners who are also passionate\nabout this cause, and who believe in Orchid’s ability to transform the way that\nusers can utilize and access the Internet.\n\nOlaf Carlson-Wee from Polychain Capita [http://polychain.capital/]l is an\ninvestor who focuses on emerging Internet-based technologies. “We’ve invested in\na number of projects that I would say focus on preserving privacy on the\nInternet and enabling people to use the Internet in a more free and open way,”\nhe said. “I’d say that cryptocurrency largely falls into this category as well.\nWe invested in Orchid because we think it’s the most sophisticated project we’ve\nseen to date that’s trying to solve problems within this space.”\n\nSteve Bell had worked with open-source advocate and technologist Brian J. Fox in\nmore than one venture. Steve and Brian had been talking years earlier about the\ndifferent ways in which restrictive firewalls could be bypassed, enabling\nfreedom of speech on the Internet. When the three of us met to discuss the\nOrchid mission, it became clear that we had the makings of the core team well\nunderway. Brian had known the software engineer and developer of Cydia, Jay\nFreeman, for years, and Jay helped us take our project from concept to\ndevelopment stage.\n\nFor an expert in creating the technology for an alternative funding model, we\nturned to Gustav Simonsson, an engineer and developer who helped launch\nEthereum. Together, this team brings an immense amount of passion, experience,\nand expertise that can make the goal of an uncensored, surveillance-free\nInternet a reality. We believe that together, we’ve created a protocol that will\ntransform the current power structure of the Internet and benefit every Internet\nuser in the world.\n\nOne of our first investors, W. Bradford Stephens of Blockchain Capital\n[http://blockchain.capital/], has known and worked with me for years. “We\nsupport blockchain enabled technologies and when you have an idea that can\nimpact and empower billions of people by creating a more open and inclusive\nInternet — with the right technology and team — we realized the benefit could\naffect everyone, no matter where you are on the planet.”\n\nDFJ Venture Capital [https://dfj.com/], another of our partners, believes,\n“Mission- and purpose-driven businesses last longer. Like open-source\ncommunities working on a common goal. These galvanizing rods let people do\namazing work. You want your employees and customers to be rooting for you. You\ncan make money anywhere, whereas changing the world, it transcends your\nexistence, and money never does that.”\n\nThe Internet is the most powerful tool for gathering information and\ncollaborating that’s ever existed. At Orchid Labs, we believe in order for its\nfullest potential to be reached, this tool needs to be available for everyone,\nfree of censorship and surveillance, and it needs to protect each user’s\npersonal data.\n\nBecause of the passion and expertise of our team, and investors who believe in\nthis mission and our ability to actuate it, we have the technology, drive, and\nresources to make this dream a reality. If you believe in these same ideals, and\nan approach that combines open-source technology backed by cryptocurrency, we\nhope that you’ll join us in our mission to realize a better Internet.\n\nWeb: Orchid Protocol [https://orchidprotcol.com/]\n\nTwitter: @orchidprotocol [https://twitter.com/orchidprotocol]","html":"<!--kg-card-begin: image--><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://blog.orchid.com/content/images/2019/10/1_onkUIOgCRAq57_wzqsYrCg.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Orchid\"></figure><!--kg-card-end: image--><p>What makes a better Internet possible?
