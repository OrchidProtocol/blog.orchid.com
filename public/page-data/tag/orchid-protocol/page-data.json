We welcome you to get set up at Orchid.com [http://orchid.com] \nand start using it today for trustless digital privacy.\n\nThe network features components designed to work together: the Orchid app (for\ndownload on Android\n[https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.orchid.Orchid&hl=en_US]), the\nOrchid VPN client that runs in the app, and the Orchid digital currency, OXT\n(available on Coinbase [https://pro.coinbase.com/trade/OXT-USD]) that powers the\nnetwork, connecting buyers and sellers of bandwidth in an open marketplace.\n\nBut the most important part of the network, what will enable it to offer users\nunprecedented digital privacy, is you. We built a privacy network because we\nbelieve that by bringing people together who value digital privacy in a world\nwhere it’s becoming scarce, and by pooling resources like Internet bandwidth —\nnot just as altruists, but as fairly incentivized market participants — we can\nsimultaneously protect ourselves and our communities. \n\nWe’re all familiar with social networks, as platforms that claim to promote\nhuman connection and sharing. However, it has become apparent that most of our\nsocial networks do the opposite, collecting value from communities in the form\nof personal data and siphoning it to a small, centralized group of individuals.\nIn contrast, our privacy network is intended to provide the growing global\ncommunity that cares with a way to free ourselves from the net of surveillance.\n\nAs we built Orchid, we spoke to many people in this community. We learned that\nour fellow Internet users consider their often involuntary participation in this\nmassive data collection experiment as a short- and long-term threat to their\nwellbeing. We heard concerns about how corporations and governments are\ncommitting our communications, search histories, and other potentially harmful\ninformation to permanent record. Our community told us they believe anyone in\nthe world should be able to pursue their curiosity, and confidently seek\nknowledge, play, connection, and culture on the Internet.\n\nThat’s why we designed Orchid as a special new kind of privacy tool that we hope\nwill help grow the privacy ecosystem and encourage more Internet users to take\nresponsibility for themselves and their communities by protecting their data.\nRather than competing with existing VPN providers, we welcomed VPN providers\nthat share our values, such as never collecting or selling user data, to provide\ntheir services on Orchid. It’s a win-win: bringing new users to values-aligned\nVPN providers, and making sure users who are happy with their services don’t\nhave to switch providers to use Orchid. It also means Orchid has bandwidth to\nmake the network usable immediately at launch.\n\nThank you to Private Internet Access [https://www.privateinternetaccess.com/],\nVPNSecure, LiquidVPN, and BolehVPN, and Bloq [https://www.bloq.com/] for\npartnering with us from day one. To everyone else who wants to sell bandwidth on\nOrchid, we welcome you too, to join our open marketplace as a seller. We will be\nreleasing detailed information on how to get set up and incentivized for selling\nbandwidth.\n\nThe Orchid app is a VPN client and privacy tool designed to give users insight\nand control over their device’s connection. Users can pay for VPN service with\nOXT on the Orchid network for more privacy than they had before. The app also\nsupports OpenVPN, so users can login with existing credentials and try the\nOrchid network later. Users also can monitor their phone’s traffic and see any\ninsecure activity, a feature that is built into the app and also free to use.\nLike all of Orchid’s software, the VPN client is Open Source, so users don’t\nhave to trust that Orchid isn’t collecting or selling user data; they can verify\nit for themselves. \n\nAnother feature that makes Orchid special is the ability to configure multi-hop\ncircuits, a first in the world of VPN clients. Instead of using only one\nprovider, which would be single-hop, Orchid users have the option to route\nthrough multiple providers. The benefit of using multiple providers is that no\nprovider can get the full picture of the user’s activity. To compare this\nbenefit to the world of physical privacy, it’s like throwing sensitive paper\nmail in the trash where it could be recovered, versus shredding it first, so\nthat the pieces could not be reassembled. Users who choose multi-hop\nconfigurations can achieve next-level digital privacy on Orchid, but should be\naware that it is an advanced feature, and is ‘use at your own risk’. Read more\ndetails at our FAQ [https://www.orchid.com/faq#security-privacy].\n\nPart of what inspired us to build Orchid was admiration for the Tor project\n[https://www.torproject.org/] and its ability to provide users with a high\ndegree of privacy. The community running Tor nodes is full of altruists driven\nto offer privacy protection to others. At Orchid, we seek to further the mission\nof providing networked privacy by incentivizing bandwidth providers, rather than\nrelying on altruism alone, in the hope that incentives bring more providers into\nthe network over the long term and produce something that is better hardened\nagainst takeover attacks. Incentives also produce a better result for users,\ngiving them more options which provide better speed and throughput.\n\nWe wanted to offer buyers and sellers the opportunity to make peer-to-peer\nmicro-transactions. It was important for us to allow users to pay directly for\njust the bandwidth they actually use. It was also important to allow users to\npay their bandwidth providers without disclosing extensive personal information\nto them, as is the case with credit card and traditional payments. That’s why\nthe Orchid digital currency, OXT, powers the Orchid network, that users of the\napp currently need in order to pay for bandwidth from providers. (In the future,\nwe anticipate our network always utilizing OXT to pay for bandwidth, but with a\nuser experience that masks Web3, so Orchid is usable by a broader community\nbeyond those versed in using digital currencies.)\n\nBandwidth providers are incentivized with OXT, which is distributed to them\nbased on how much bandwidth they provide according to our system of\nprobabilistic nanopayments. In order to become a provider and start being\nincentivized, potential providers must stake digital currency.

To learn more about\nstaking, read this one\n[https://blog.orchid.com/orchids-network-random-selection-stake-weighting/].\n\nIn our FAQ [https://www.orchid.com/faq] we explain the privacy tradeoffs\nassociated with our choice to use the Ethereum blockchain, and why we made it.\nWe hope to spread awareness among users of all privacy tools that privacy is a\nspectrum, not a black-and-white binary. There are different degrees and\ndefinitions of privacy out there, and it’s important to us at Orchid to provide\nusers with  the information they need to make the right privacy decisions for\nthemselves based on their individual privacy goals and use cases.\n\nWe care about your privacy when you use our network and app, and when you visit\nour website Orchid.com. For this reason, we do not use any third-party trackers,\nsuch as the typical Google Analytics or a Facebook pixel, on our site. Your\npersonal data is not known to us or stored. The same goes with the app; we’re\nnot tracking you as you use it. It’s an unavoidable truth that collecting\ninformation on who our users are and how they’re using the product would save us\ntime and money, but as a privacy tool, that would be against our values. We\ninvite other organizations that share these values to join us and abstain from\nthird-party tracking.\n\nAt Orchid, we believe the Internet can be reclaimed by its users. It’s a shared\nresource that we should be able to explore freely, with the confidence to pursue\nour curiosity. To spread this message we’re tweeting about our launch with the\nhashtag #staycurious.

At Orchid Labs\n[http://www.orchidprotocol.com/], our goal is to ensure that every person on\nEarth can have access to an open, decentralized, and uncensored Internet. We\nbelieve a better Internet is one that isn’t controlled by the few, but open to\nall.\n\nCurrently, Internet access for the majority of the people on Earth is censored\nand monitored. Because of this, many Internet users are blocked from freely\ncommunicating, collaborating, and accessing information. The current centralized\nsystem, which limits our ability to communicate and learn — while also\nharvesting and selling our personal data — is far from the full potential of\nwhat the internet could be and strays from the original intention of its\ncreators.\n\nThat’s why we’ve launched the Orchid Protocol, an open-source overlay network\nthat uses excess bandwidth on top of the existing Internet to ensure that people\n— no matter where they live on our planet — can have unrestricted access to\ninformation and collaboration. Orchid’s protocol combines surplus bandwidth,\nstate-of-the-art encryption, and a decentralized infrastructure enabling any\nInternet user to participate and exchange bandwidth for payment in peer-to-peer\ntransactions using Orchid tokens on the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nOur team consists of engineers, cryptocurrency experts, technologists, and\npartners dedicated to creating an Internet free of surveillance and censorship.\nThis idea isn’t new; there are people across the globe dedicated to this cause.\nWe believe the Orchid Protocol will help the world finally create this reality.\n\nWhile I’ve been interested in the idea of Internet freedom for some time, the\norigins of Orchid stem from conversations with Steve Bell, an entrepreneur with\nmore than a decade of experience backing Chinese seed stage startups. We had\nboth personally experienced and witnessed the consequences of surveillance and\ncensorship in our work across the world. My concern was one of surveillance,\nwhile Steve’s was one of censorship or access. My perspective was, “how do\ncommunicate or access information in a potentially totalitarian state in a\nprivate fashion”. I had also experience security issues first hand, both during\nthe Bitstamp hack of 2015\n[https://techcrunch.com/2015/01/05/bitstamp-bitcoin-exchange-hack/] and in\nhaving my own phone ported\n[https://medium.com/@stevewaterhouse/notes-on-recovering-from-a-hack-3cd438e10fe0]\n.\n\nWe started discussing ways to create an internet free of surveillance and\ncensorship that everyone in the world could access. With a passion for where we\nwanted to go and a firm idea of how to get there, we knew we needed the\ntechnological expertise and funding to make this happen.\n\nFortunately, we’ve met many technologists and partners who are also passionate\nabout this cause, and who believe in Orchid’s ability to transform the way that\nusers can utilize and access the Internet.\n\nOlaf Carlson-Wee from Polychain Capita [http://polychain.capital/]l is an\ninvestor who focuses on emerging Internet-based technologies. “We’ve invested in\na number of projects that I would say focus on preserving privacy on the\nInternet and enabling people to use the Internet in a more free and open way,”\nhe said. “I’d say that cryptocurrency largely falls into this category as well.\nWe invested in Orchid because we think it’s the most sophisticated project we’ve\nseen to date that’s trying to solve problems within this space.”\n\nSteve Bell had worked with open-source advocate and technologist Brian J. Fox in\nmore than one venture. Steve and Brian had been talking years earlier about the\ndifferent ways in which restrictive firewalls could be bypassed, enabling\nfreedom of speech on the Internet. When the three of us met to discuss the\nOrchid mission, it became clear that we had the makings of the core team well\nunderway. Brian had known the software engineer and developer of Cydia, Jay\nFreeman, for years, and Jay helped us take our project from concept to\ndevelopment stage.\n\nFor an expert in creating the technology for an alternative funding model, we\nturned to Gustav Simonsson, an engineer and developer who helped launch\nEthereum. Together, this team brings an immense amount of passion, experience,\nand expertise that can make the goal of an uncensored, surveillance-free\nInternet a reality. We believe that together, we’ve created a protocol that will\ntransform the current power structure of the Internet and benefit every Internet\nuser in the world.\n\nOne of our first investors, W. Bradford Stephens of Blockchain Capital\n[http://blockchain.capital/], has known and worked with me for years. “We\nsupport blockchain enabled technologies and when you have an idea that can\nimpact and empower billions of people by creating a more open and inclusive\nInternet — with the right technology and team — we realized the benefit could\naffect everyone, no matter where you are on the planet.”\n\nDFJ Venture Capital [https://dfj.com/], another of our partners, believes,\n“Mission- and purpose-driven businesses last longer. Like open-source\ncommunities working on a common goal. These galvanizing rods let people do\namazing work. You want your employees and customers to be rooting for you. You\ncan make money anywhere, whereas changing the world, it transcends your\nexistence, and money never does that.”\n\nThe Internet is the most powerful tool for gathering information and\ncollaborating that’s ever existed. At Orchid Labs, we believe in order for its\nfullest potential to be reached, this tool needs to be available for everyone,\nfree of censorship and surveillance, and it needs to protect each user’s\npersonal data.\n\nBecause of the passion and expertise of our team, and investors who believe in\nthis mission and our ability to actuate it, we have the technology, drive, and\nresources to make this dream a reality. If you believe in these same ideals, and\nan approach that combines open-source technology backed by cryptocurrency, we\nhope that you’ll join us in our mission to realize a better Internet.\n\nWeb: Orchid Protocol [https://orchidprotcol.com/]\n\nTwitter: @orchidprotocol [https://twitter.com/orchidprotocol]","html":"<!--kg-card-begin: image--><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://blog.orchid.com/content/images/2019/10/1_onkUIOgCRAq57_wzqsYrCg.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Orchid\"></figure><!--kg-card-end: image--><p>What makes a better Internet possible?
