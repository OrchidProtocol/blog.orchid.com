But what does privacy mean? How\nprivate is Orchid, which relies on pseudo-anonymous payments on Ethereum? In\nthis post, we explore the concept of “privacy” and how Orchid leverages multiple\ninnovations to deliver on its goals.\n\nWhat do we mean when we say privacy?\nOne of a typical VPN app’s central UI features is a prominent “on/off” button.\nThe simple two state design will feel familiar to anyone who uses a VPN. It\nmakes for a simple user experience in which it is obvious to people whether or\nnot the VPN is engaged and they are receiving the benefit or not.\n\nBut in truth, privacy is more nuanced than a simple binary of “on” or “off”.\nIt’s a spectrum. Different users have different objectives and use cases for\nemploying privacy tools. Some are trying to access content from a geography\nwhere that content is blocked. Others simply want to browse the Internet while\nkeeping their identity and activity private. Even within private browsing, there\nare sub-use cases, depending on whom you want privacy from. Do you want to keep\nthe medical condition you were researching private, so that your mobile carrier\nor home Internet provider can’t sell the data those websites collect to\nadvertisers? Are you a political dissident in a country that would jail you for\nyour views? The more sophisticated the organization and the harder they’re\ntrying to track you, the more difficult it is to achieve privacy from them.\n\nDifferent use cases require different levels of privacy\nTo illustrate where various privacy needs and solutions fall relative to one\nanother, it’s worth considering a few different use cases. At the most severe\nend, a person might be looking for privacy from an extremely sophisticated\nactor, such as a hostile government. This could be for a number of reasons, and\nwe won’t get into the ethics of those here. One key point we would like to make\nis a technical one. A major government intelligence apparatus is exceedingly\ndifficult to maintain privacy from. A fugitive -- Edward Snowden, for example --\ncould not depend on a VPN alone. Advanced state actors possess extremely\nsophisticated technical as well as legal tools, some beyond the abilities and\nunderstanding of commercially available security techniques. \n\nVPNs can and do, however, play a vital part in protecting the privacy of\ndissidents, journalists, and others who are under threat from governments in\nmany cases. In Venezuela, for example, they are an essential tool for opposition\nfigures.\n\nThat said, most people want Internet privacy for far more quotidian and\nrelatable reasons: either to access content that is blocked in a particular\ngeography, or to protect themselves from being hacked or tracked as they browse\nthe Internet day to day. In these cases, a VPN solves the problem by encrypting\ntraffic, protecting a user’s IP address and by exiting in a different geography.\n\nTake the example of a startup executive using a public WiFi network while on an\nairport layover. Hackers often take advantage of public, unsecured networks to\nsteal sensitive information from unsuspecting users. The executive in this\nexample could -- should -- use a VPN to protect herself and her company’s\nintellectual property from the bad actors that may be lurking. In this case, the\nVPN adds a critical layer of protection.\n\nEnter Orchid: the Privacy Network\nThe Orchid network is a new kind of p2p network for privacy. Instead of relying\non volunteers, Orchid uses financial incentives to align the actors in the\nsystem and reward healthy network growth. Enough supply and demand will exist on\nthe network at launch to provide sufficient capabilities for users. Over time,\nOrchid can grow to the point that it offers network security beyond anything\ncurrently available. One thing is for sure: Orchid will take on a life of its\nown — it is permissionless, decentralized, and incentivized to grow. \n\nThe Orchid app is the first client side application that can harness the new\nOrchid network, allowing users to create VPN connections for privacy. The app\ngoes further than a typical VPN in two important ways: by offering advanced\nfeatures for multi-hop circuits, and by providing a monitoring tool to reveal\ninsecure connections.\n\nWhat protections does the Orchid app provide today?\nStandard Internet connections operate by transmitting packets of data. Different\nrouters and physical infrastructure can see these packets as they move from the\nsource to the destination Their owners are therefore in a position to build a\nprofile of the Internet usage of their paying user (you!) They can also block\ncontent as they see fit. Typically these infrastructure owners are ISPs — mobile\ncarriers providing phone data connections, home cable Internet providers, and\nWiFi hotspot operators. In all these cases, the ISP is in an advantaged position\nto monitor and/or restrict Internet usage. It is common in many countries for\nISPs to restrict content so that users cannot load certain websites.\n\nIn Orchid, users gain privacy by configuring a single- or multi-hop circuit and\nfunding it with OXT. With a single-hop circuit, Orchid:\n\n * Prevents websites from seeing your real IP address and physical location;\n * Prevents your ISP from seeing what websites you are visiting and when;\n * Enables access to the open Internet--once a user can connect to Orchid, they\n   are not restricted by ISP level firewalls and can browse the entire Internet\n   freely.\n\nA potential problem with using only a single VPN provider is that the provider\nrunning the single node circuit knows both your IP address and the content you\nare accessing. One solution is to trust no single provider with enough\ninformation to know both who you are and what information you are accessing. To\nthat end, Orchid supports an advanced feature that allows users to configure\nmulti-hop routes by stringing together multiple nodes into a flexible multi-hop\ncircuit. Orchid currently supports several underlying protocols including the\nnative Orchid VPN protocol and OpenVPN, allowing users to mix and match Orchid\nnodes with traditional VPN nodes.  While the potential is there to protect the\nuser from any one provider knowing enough information to reveal their circuit,\nthis is an advanced feature that is currently “use at your own risk”.\n\nPrivacy and public payments\nThe Orchid app pays for it’s circuit by authorizing a continuous stream of tiny\nnanopayments to providers for the duration of the connection. While the \nnanopayment architecture [https://blog.orchid.com/introducing-nanopayments] \nlocks user funds into a smart contract and only issues on-chain payments to\nproviders very rarely, occasional winning tickets result in OXT payments posted\non the public Ethereum blockchain. When that happens, the user’s Ethereum\naddress, the provider’s Ethereum address, and a timestamp are stored publically\non the Ethereum blockchain. Note that the payment address of the provider is not\na mapping to any single server; instead it is an arbitrary (and potentially\ntemporary) payment address that the provider created specifically to receive\nfunds. Also, the frequency of how often on-chain payments occur is configurable.\n\nAll information gained by a potential network attacker constitutes an advantage.\nHowever, consider exactly what information is revealed. For an Orchid user\nrunning a single hop circuit, the information revealed includes: \n\n * The user’s payment address when service starts is seen by the provider\n * The user’s real IP and destination addresses is seen by the provider\n * When a rare on-chain payment is made, the user’s address and provider’s\n   address are stored on Ethereum with a timestamp available to the public\n\nWhen considering anonymity, it is important to understand if the user is linked\nto the OXT used in their circuit. Worst case, if the user purchased OXT on an\nexchange with their real identity, or the VPN provider used in the circuit\nmaintained logs, then either of those two entities could be compelled to give\ninformation that could deanonymize the user. Similarly, a user who paid for a\nVPN service that maintained logs with a credit card could be deanonymized with\nthat provider being compelled. \n\nA multi-hop circuit affords greater network protections, but to setup a\nmulti-hop Orchid circuit, it would be naive to pay for each hop from the same\nEthereum wallet. In that configuration, each provider would be able to see that\nwallet’s address and potentially use that address to get information about the\nuser. To mitigate that, a better way to setup multi-hop circuits would be to use\ndifferent wallet addresses for each Orchid hop. If every wallet address is\nindependently dissociated from the user, the full circuit might be quite\ndifficult to link back to the user. Again, multi-hop circuits in Orchid are an\nadvanced feature; use at your own risk.\n\nOrchid is working on additional features to mitigate payment leakage, such as\nonion payment routing.  The idea of this technique is to help obfuscate payments\nby routing them through several layers of indirection (paying Alice to pay Bob\nto pay Charlie). The payments then take a different random route than the\ntraffic, preventing the rare occasional public payment records from indirectly\nrevealing route information.\n\nOrchid is a privacy movement\nThe goal of Orchid is to start a new network, ecosystem and Open Source movement\nto create new privacy tools with stronger protections and capabilities than we\nhave right now. Our mission is to restore the open and accessible Internet for\neveryone.
