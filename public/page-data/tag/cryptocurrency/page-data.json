The viable\ndefenses against systemic attacks in an open decentralized system are ultimately\neconomic — a system is secure to the extent that the cost of an attack to an\nattacker outweighs the benefits to that attacker, or is too costly to execute\nregardless. Decentralized systems use these security parameters to secure their\nnetworks and provide incentives by which miners or participants can earn in\nreturn. Most open blockchains today use one of two models: proof-of-work, which\nrequires electricity; or proof-of-stake, which requires coordination efforts and\ngovernance. The Orchid Network is expected to use a derivative of\nproof-of-stake, called stake weighting, to authenticate peer-to-peer bandwidth\nagreements combined with Ethereum’s consensus to settle transactions.\n\nThis means that bandwidth providers stake Orchid cryptocurrency for commercial\nuse on the Orchid Network (OXT) in time-locked deposits to prove identity and\nreceive traffic in proportion to relative stake deposit size. We evolved our\ndesign to use stake-weighting after originally considering using proof-of-work,\nwhich is described in our original white paper as Medallions. We moved away from\nthat system because:\n\n * Proof-of-work creates an additional compute burden on end users\n * Proof-of-work has far lower attack costs than stake-weighting with delay,\n   even assuming rental markets\n * General compute rental markets already exist with far more relative liquidity\n   than we expect will exist in any future OXT stake deposit rental markets\n\nThe Orchid Network\nThe Orchid Network is designed to be a set of data structures stored on the\nEthereum blockchain that allows clients to efficiently select bandwidth sellers’\nnodes. Essentially, it forms a simple Orchid-specific overlay on the Ethereum\nnetwork.\n\nAt a high level, the Orchid Network is expected to provide the following key\noperations:\n\n * A means for bandwidth providers to register their nodes via staking\n * A method for bandwidth providers to register custom services and metadata\n * A means for clients to query nodes for custom services and metadata\n * A method for selecting a random node, with probability proportional to stake\n\nThe use of stake-weighting is intended to allow the economic security of the\nOrchid Network to scale linearly with the size of the total deposited stake. The\nstake-weighted selection process itself is implemented using an on-chain tree\ndata structure, which is intended to allow a client to outsource the selection\nof nodes to other nodes in a scalable trustless manner, avoiding the need for\nlightweight clients to ever download, store, or process the complete node\ndirectory.\n\nNode directory tree\nTo implement the scan function efficiently, we use an on-chain binary weighted\ntree data structure. Each node in the tree is expected to be a stake entry,\nwhich stores a stakee, an amount, and a delay, in addition to the tree pointers\nand stake subtotals for the left and right subtrees. This structure effectively\nforms a prefix sum tree over all the stake deposits, allowing a simple descent\ndecision at each node to find the subtree (or internode) containing a given\nrandom point; finding the exact node containing the given random point is\nexpected to require only a logarithmic number of steps.\n\nNode metadata registry\nThe Node metadata registry is anticipated to allow providers to ‘tag’ nodes with\nmetadata. Bandwidth providers can use this to store custom metadata associated\nwith their nodes on the blockchain and advertise services. The metadata registry\nis structured to be generic in order to enable a simple means for future custom\nextensions. This is intended to allow node operators to advertise new services,\nwhich clients can then select for without code updates.\n\nOrchid App users interested in filtering service based on certain criteria, such\nas geography, are expected to be able to use tags to do so. Since tags are\npieces of metadata added by providers, ultimately the Orchid App must check\nwhether the provider is acting honestly. In many cases, we expect the checks\nwill be automated.\n\nExamples of Metadata Tags:\n\n * Geolocation: Providers are expected to be able to advertise their service in\n   a particular region so that clients can filter based on location (similar to\n   a typical VPN service). The Orchid App will use a public IP database to\n   confirm the location.\n * Latency: In some cases users will desire connections with lower latency than\n   randomly chosen nodes. The Orchid App is designed to employ a\n   ‘guess-and-check’ strategy by using the same public IP database to find\n   routes with a shorter distance. Ultimately, the actual latency must be\n   measured once a route is constructed. If the latency is higher than the\n   target threshold, we expect that a new, different route must be sampled. The\n   lightweight nature of Orchid routes and nanopayments is anticipated to allow\n   for fast route setup and parallel route testing.\n * Price: Providers are anticipated to set their bandwidth prices and the client\n   can filter on price. The Orchid App intends to use a budgeting algorithm to\n   determine a current spending cap based on the user’s balance and a target\n   timespan representing how long the budget should last.\n\nCurated lists\nThe Orchid App is designed to also filter based on arbitrary exit or relay node\nlists, which limits the viable nodes to a custom subset. Initial releases of the\nofficial Orchid App is expected to use this feature to prevent certain kinds of\nattacks from malicious exit nodes (e.g. SSL downgrade attacks) by using a\ndefault exit node list consisting of trusted VPN partners. Customized Orchid\nclients can use their own lists, and eventually we expect well known third\nparties to emerge as whitelist curators. Curated lists are a simple means for\nthe importation of external reputational trust to supplement the economic,\nincentive-based trust provided by staking.\n\nHow to sell bandwidth on Orchid\nThe Orchid Market uses a decentralized architecture to connect users to\nbandwidth providers via tokenized, peer-to-peer commercial nano-transactions.\n\nTo sell bandwidth, providers register nodes on the Ethereum blockchain, which\nclients select through calls to Ethereum smart contracts. The user running the\nOrchid App then initiates proxy chain connections, which connect through one or\nmore relay nodes before an exit node to their destination. Clients are expected\nto pay bandwidth providers to forward packets using probabilistic nanopayments.\nOccasionally the seller is expected to receive a winning nanopayment ticket\nwhich they redeem for Orchid Tokens (OXT) through a smart contract function\ncall.\n\nA requirement for registering a node in the Orchid Network is to stake OXT. The\nsize of the stake is crucial for the stake-weighted selection and the more OXT\nthat is staked, the greater the probability that the provider will receive\nrequests for traffic from the Orchid App users.\n\nWe anticipate that there are three steps to earning as a Node operator:\n\n * Acquire OXT: Buy OXT tokens from an exchange or recieve OXT in a wallet\n   through transfer, or earn OXT by registering as a node provider.\n * Stake OXT: Deposit OXT tokens into the node directory contract\n * Provide: Sell services to the Orchid App users\n * Payment: Receive OXT payment for services in a provider controlled wallet\n\nUser stake deposit\nFor Orchid App users to join the network, they must have a valid deposit in the\nnanopayment smart contract in order to issue tickets to a provider in exchange\nfor bandwidth. A small portion of this deposit is intended to be held in escrow\nas a user “stake” to align their incentives with that of the network as a whole.\n\nHow nodes are selected\nApps are expected to select nodes for proxy chains using a two-step process of\nrandom relative stake-weighted linear selection followed by secondary constraint\nfiltering. The first stage linear selection is designed to be performed by the\nscan function on the node directory tree. The App generates a random point\nlocally and passes it on as the single argument to scan, which then descends\ndown the node directory tree. The search terminates in the single unique leaf —\nor internode — whose stake segment intersects the chosen random point.\n\nUsing a smart contract to implement the main node scan function allows the\nselection process to be easily outsourced to server nodes. A client requests one\nor more scan calls and a remote server node executes each scan locally and send\nback simple proofs of the execution trace.\n\nAfter selecting one or more nodes based on linear relative stake weighting, it\nis designed such that the client can then filter by additional criteria such as\nexit location, latency (ping), price, custom node metadata tags, and arbitrary\nwhitelists.\n\nStake withdrawal delay\nOrchid stake deposits can not be withdrawn immediately; they are subject to an\nintentional withdrawal delay limitation. The withdrawal delay is an important\nsecurity restriction. It creates an obstacle for attackers attempting to acquire\na large portion of Orchid App connection requests. In particular, it helps\nprevent a systemic takeover attack. This is an attack in which an adversary\nacquires a large fraction of the total deposit stake and then directs clients to\nmalicious servers, which provide intentionally poor connections, log and report\ntraffic, or attempt active connection attacks (e.g. SSL downgrades).\n\nWe believe the main defense against systemic takeover attacks is the high cost\nbarrier to acquiring and locking up a significant fraction of the total OXT\nstake. Without a withdrawal delay, this barrier becomes simply an issue of\naccess to sufficient liquidity, with little actual net cost to an attack.\n\nA sufficiently long withdrawal delay is more likely to create an additional loss\nfor the attacker when they finally end the attack and sell their large OXT\nposition. The App software then filters based on withdrawal delay, ignoring\nstake deposits with delays that do not meet the App threshold. Orchid’s initial\nApp software will accept withdrawal delays of three months or greater, but the\nflexible parameterization allows future App updates to change this parameter\nwithout the equivalent of a hard fork and associated coordination difficulties.\n\nConclusion\nBy adopting a stake-weighting approach to disincentivize attacks and creating an\nincentivized marketplace backed by the Orchid Token, we’re one step closer to\nachieving our ultimate goal: making the Internet a more open, inclusive space\nfor users around the world. Whether you want to purchase or sell resources using\nthe Orchid, the Orchid Network is designed to give users private and secure\naccess to the internet, regardless of geographic location.
