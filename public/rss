<p>From the beginning, VPNs have been largely been utilized by three groups:</p>
<ol>
<li>Companies concerned with information security</li>
<li>Users concerned about privacy</li>
<li>People in countries where governments restricted access to information and communication</li>
</ol>
<p>Two decades after the advent of PPTP, the reasons why we use VPNs essentially haven’t changed. What has changed is the number of internet users now utilizing VPNs. The number of VPN users is now <a href="https://www.go-globe.com/blog/vpn-usage-statistics/">climbing by tens of millions of people each year</a>, and that number is projected to accelerate.</p>
<p>What’s behind this acceleration? An increasing number of people are concerned about their online privacy as data harvesting becomes more intrusive, more complete. And as internet use becomes intrinsically tied to our everyday lives, more governments are moving to restrict the type of information that their citizens can access.</p>
<p>A decade ago, only a small percentage of internet users were utilizing VPNs. Because of this, there was a sort of stigma—which still lingers today—around VPNs.</p>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><h3 id="the-desire-for-privacy-is-normal-not-suspicious">The desire for Privacy Is Normal, Not Suspicious</h3><p>To some, particularly in the U.S., there’s an idea that the desire for online privacy equates to a quest for anonymity in order to undertake illicit, nefarious activities. This narrative conjures images of the dark web. </p><p>But over the past few years, we’ve become aware of how pervasive online data capturing is. And at the same time, we’ve seen how our personal data can be sold or compromised by third parties. Because of that, people who just a short while ago were asking “Why would I need online privacy? I have nothing to hide,” are now asking “How can I better protect myself?”</p><p>Consider something as seemingly benign as looking up symptoms for a medical condition online. <a href="http://www.nbcnews.com/id/3077086/t/more-people-search-health-online/#.XPGXZYhKiM9">80% of Americans have searched health-related topics</a>, most without a second thought. What could go wrong? </p><p>When you look up a medical symptom, like any other page you visit on the internet, someone is capturing that data. The consequences of this could range from awkward—looking up a potentially embarrassing ailment only to have ads served back to you while in the company of others, too dangerous—once this data is sold in third-party apps, <a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/medical-symptoms/should-you-google-your-medical-symptoms/">a buyer may be able to steal your medical identity</a>. </p><p>For reasons like the above, many people—in nations where access to information and communication are relatively unhindered—are turning to VPNs simply for security and protection. </p><h3 id="access-to-information-communication-and-entertainment-isn-t-radical">Access to Information, Communication, and Entertainment Isn’t Radical</h3><p>Another narrative revolves around the idea that VPNs are the territory of radicals or militants. As more governments move to clamp down on communication and information, the notion of VPNs as simply a tool of activists or rebels fighting regimes is going away. In reality, most VPN users do so <a href="https://thebestvpn.com/vpn-usage-statistics/">to access entertainment, messaging apps, news websites, and social media</a>. </p><!--kg-card-begin: image--><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://orchid-ghost-admin.circleclick.com/content/images/2019/11/vpn-usage-by-country.png" class="kg-image" alt="Why Ordinary People Are Turning to VPNs"/></figure><!--kg-card-end: image--><p>In this way, we can see that the vast majority of people using VPNs in countries with repressive regimes are simply doing so in order to use the internet like anyone else. VPN usage isn’t nearly as radical in this sense as a government trying to control every detail of information that its citizens can see. China recently provided a good example of what this means. </p><p><a href="https://slate.com/technology/2019/05/wikipedia-china-block-censorship-tiananmen-square.html">In May, China moved to block all versions, in any language, of Wikipedia</a>. The timing of which (like previous blocks of Wikipedia) coincides with the anniversary of the 1989 events at Tiananmen Square. It’s quintessentially Orwellian. In the dystopian masterpiece 1984, Orwell wrote, “Who controls the past controls the future: who controls the present controls the past.”</p><p>And China is far from alone. Turkey has blocked all of Wikipedia since 2017 in the name of “national security.” Iran consistently blocks articles it wants to hide from its citizens. </p><p>There’s something darkly unsettling about regimes so authoritarian that they try to hide the history of their recent past, shoveling it like dust into a rubbish bin, in order to try and gain support and control of the populace. There’s danger there, not only for the citizens of those countries, but for the rest of us hopeful of learning from past mistakes to create a better future as well.</p><p>As we’ve seen with Russian election meddling and the current distrust of Huawei, your data may seem safe but the likelihood of it ending up in the hands of a regime who exploits you is increasing by the day.  </p><h3 id="vpns-may-be-the-new-normal">VPNs May Be the New Normal</h3><p>If you look at the <a href="https://www.vpnmentor.com/blog/vpn-use-data-privacy-stats/">list nations with the highest percentage of VPN users</a>, there’s a direct correlation between that list and government interference with an open internet. It’s a desire for access to information, communications with family abroad, or entertainment that makes VPNs so popular in these nations. </p><p>And in countries where we can actually stream our favorite series from an app or access Wikipedia, VPN use is still climbing as a result of data privacy concerns. </p><p>As long as governments and corporations continue to attempt to control our online experiences, the percentage of people utilizing VPNs is only going to grow. The old tropes of online privacy and access being the territory of the radical and nefarious are being ameliorated as the people in control of the internet force us to think of how we can protect and enable ourselves online. </p><p>The real question for many of us, now, is simply how can we find a <a href="https://medium.com/orchid-labs/why-we-need-a-better-vpn-aebe8c352984">VPN that promises us security and privacy in the way that we deserve</a>? </p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Orchid’s Network: Random Selection + Stake Weighting]]></title><description><![CDATA[The web of providers running the Orchid Server software constitutes the Orchid Network.

The viable defenses against systemic attacks in an open decentralized system are ultimately economic — a system is secure to the extent that the cost of an attack to an attacker outweighs the benefits to that attacker, or is too costly to execute regardless. Decentralized systems use these security parameters to secure their networks and provide incentives by which miners or participants can earn in return. Most open blockchains today use one of two models: proof-of-work, which requires electricity; or proof-of-stake, which requires coordination efforts and governance. The Orchid Network is expected to use a derivative of proof-of-stake, called stake weighting, to authenticate peer-to-peer bandwidth agreements combined with Ethereum’s consensus to settle transactions.</p><p>This means that bandwidth providers stake Orchid cryptocurrency for commercial use on the Orchid Network (OXT) in time-locked deposits to prove identity and receive traffic in proportion to relative stake deposit size. We evolved our design to use stake-weighting after originally considering using proof-of-work, which is described in our original white paper as Medallions. We moved away from that system because:</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><ul>
<li>Proof-of-work creates an additional compute burden on end users</li>
<li>Proof-of-work has far lower attack costs than stake-weighting with delay, even assuming rental markets</li>
<li>General compute rental markets already exist with far more relative liquidity than we expect will exist in any future OXT stake deposit rental markets</li>
</ul>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><h2 id="theorchidnetwork">The Orchid Network</h2>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>The Orchid Network is designed to be a set of data structures stored on the Ethereum blockchain that allows clients to efficiently select bandwidth sellers’ nodes. Essentially, it forms a simple Orchid-specific overlay on the Ethereum network.</p><p>At a high level, the Orchid Network is expected to provide the following key operations:</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><ul>
<li>A means for bandwidth providers to register their nodes via staking</li>
<li>A method for bandwidth providers to register custom services and metadata</li>
<li>A means for clients to query nodes for custom services and metadata</li>
<li>A method for selecting a random node, with probability proportional to stake</li>
</ul>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>The use of stake-weighting is intended to allow the economic security of the Orchid Network to scale linearly with the size of the total deposited stake. The stake-weighted selection process itself is implemented using an on-chain tree data structure, which is intended to allow a client to outsource the selection of nodes to other nodes in a scalable trustless manner, avoiding the need for lightweight clients to ever download, store, or process the complete node directory.</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><h2 id="nodedirectorytree">Node directory tree</h2>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>To implement the scan function efficiently, we use an on-chain binary weighted tree data structure. Each node in the tree is expected to be a stake entry, which stores a stakee, an amount, and a delay, in addition to the tree pointers and stake subtotals for the left and right subtrees. This structure effectively forms a prefix sum tree over all the stake deposits, allowing a simple descent decision at each node to find the subtree (or internode) containing a given random point; finding the exact node containing the given random point is expected to require only a logarithmic number of steps.</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><h2 id="nodemetadataregistry">Node metadata registry</h2>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>The Node metadata registry is anticipated to allow providers to ‘tag’ nodes with metadata. Bandwidth providers can use this to store custom metadata associated with their nodes on the blockchain and advertise services. The metadata registry is structured to be generic in order to enable a simple means for future custom extensions. This is intended to allow node operators to advertise new services, which clients can then select for without code updates.</p><p>Orchid App users interested in filtering service based on certain criteria, such as geography, are expected to be able to use tags to do so. Since tags are pieces of metadata added by providers, ultimately the Orchid App must check whether the provider is acting honestly. In many cases, we expect the checks will be automated.</p><p>Examples of Metadata Tags:</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><ul>
<li><strong>Geolocation</strong>: Providers are expected to be able to advertise their service in a particular region so that clients can filter based on location (similar to a typical VPN service). The Orchid App will use a public IP database to confirm the location.</li>
<li><strong>Latency</strong>: In some cases users will desire connections with lower latency than randomly chosen nodes. The Orchid App is designed to employ a ‘guess-and-check’ strategy by using the same public IP database to find routes with a shorter distance. Ultimately, the actual latency must be measured once a route is constructed. If the latency is higher than the target threshold, we expect that a new, different route must be sampled. The lightweight nature of Orchid routes and nanopayments is anticipated to allow for fast route setup and parallel route testing.</li>
<li><strong>Price</strong>: Providers are anticipated to set their bandwidth prices and the client can filter on price. The Orchid App intends to use a budgeting algorithm to determine a current spending cap based on the user’s balance and a target timespan representing how long the budget should last.</li>
</ul>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><h2 id="curatedlists">Curated lists</h2>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>The Orchid App is designed to also filter based on arbitrary exit or relay node lists, which limits the viable nodes to a custom subset. Initial releases of the official Orchid App is expected to use this feature to prevent certain kinds of attacks from malicious exit nodes (e.g. SSL downgrade attacks) by using a default exit node list consisting of trusted VPN partners. Customized Orchid clients can use their own lists, and eventually we expect well known third parties to emerge as whitelist curators. Curated lists are a simple means for the importation of external reputational trust to supplement the economic, incentive-based trust provided by staking.</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><h2 id="howtosellbandwidthonorchid">How to sell bandwidth on Orchid</h2>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>The Orchid Market uses a decentralized architecture to connect users to bandwidth providers via tokenized, peer-to-peer commercial nano-transactions.</p><!--kg-card-begin: image--><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://orchid-ghost-admin.circleclick.com/content/images/2019/11/image-4.png" class="kg-image" alt="Orchid’s Network: Random Selection + Stake Weighting"/></figure><!--kg-card-end: image--><p>To sell bandwidth, providers register nodes on the Ethereum blockchain, which clients select through calls to Ethereum smart contracts. The user running the Orchid App then initiates proxy chain connections, which connect through one or more relay nodes before an exit node to their destination. Clients are expected to pay bandwidth providers to forward packets using probabilistic nanopayments. Occasionally the seller is expected to receive a winning nanopayment ticket which they redeem for Orchid Tokens (OXT) through a smart contract function call.</p><p>A requirement for registering a node in the Orchid Network is to stake OXT. The size of the stake is crucial for the stake-weighted selection and the more OXT that is staked, the greater the probability that the provider will receive requests for traffic from the Orchid App users.</p><p>We anticipate that there are three steps to earning as a Node operator:</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><ul>
<li><strong>Acquire OXT</strong>: Buy OXT tokens from an exchange or recieve OXT in a wallet through transfer, or earn OXT by registering as a node provider.</li>
<li><strong>Stake OXT</strong>: Deposit OXT tokens into the node directory contract</li>
<li><strong>Provide</strong>: Sell services to the Orchid App users</li>
<li><strong>Payment</strong>: Receive OXT payment for services in a provider controlled wallet</li>
</ul>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><h2 id="userstakedeposit">User stake deposit</h2>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>For Orchid App users to join the network, they must have a valid deposit in the nanopayment smart contract in order to issue tickets to a provider in exchange for bandwidth. A small portion of this deposit is intended to be held in escrow as a user “stake” to align their incentives with that of the network as a whole.</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><h2 id="hownodesareselected">How nodes are selected</h2>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>Apps are expected to select nodes for proxy chains using a two-step process of random relative stake-weighted linear selection followed by secondary constraint filtering. The first stage linear selection is designed to be performed by the scan function on the node directory tree. The App generates a random point locally and passes it on as the single argument to scan, which then descends down the node directory tree. The search terminates in the single unique leaf — or internode — whose stake segment intersects the chosen random point.</p><p>Using a smart contract to implement the main node scan function allows the selection process to be easily outsourced to server nodes. A client requests one or more scan calls and a remote server node executes each scan locally and send back simple proofs of the execution trace.</p><p>After selecting one or more nodes based on linear relative stake weighting, it is designed such that the client can then filter by additional criteria such as exit location, latency (ping), price, custom node metadata tags, and arbitrary whitelists.</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><h2 id="stakewithdrawaldelay">Stake withdrawal delay</h2>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>Orchid stake deposits can not be withdrawn immediately; they are subject to an intentional withdrawal delay limitation. The withdrawal delay is an important security restriction. It creates an obstacle for attackers attempting to acquire a large portion of Orchid App connection requests. In particular, it helps prevent a systemic takeover attack. This is an attack in which an adversary acquires a large fraction of the total deposit stake and then directs clients to malicious servers, which provide intentionally poor connections, log and report traffic, or attempt active connection attacks (e.g. SSL downgrades).</p><p>We believe the main defense against systemic takeover attacks is the high cost barrier to acquiring and locking up a significant fraction of the total OXT stake. Without a withdrawal delay, this barrier becomes simply an issue of access to sufficient liquidity, with little actual net cost to an attack.</p><p>A sufficiently long withdrawal delay is more likely to create an additional loss for the attacker when they finally end the attack and sell their large OXT position. The App software then filters based on withdrawal delay, ignoring stake deposits with delays that do not meet the App threshold. Orchid’s initial App software will accept withdrawal delays of three months or greater, but the flexible parameterization allows future App updates to change this parameter without the equivalent of a hard fork and associated coordination difficulties.</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>By adopting a stake-weighting approach to disincentivize attacks and creating an incentivized marketplace backed by the Orchid Token, we’re one step closer to achieving our ultimate goal: making the Internet a more open, inclusive space for users around the world. Whether you want to purchase or sell resources using the Orchid, the Orchid Network is designed to give users private and secure access to the internet, regardless of geographic location.

<p>Using a distributed system allows you, as a user, to distribute trust across multiple distinct VPN providers, thereby breaking apart the flow of your information so no single entity can see the entire picture.</p>
</blockquote>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>In the Orchid marketplace, incentives are used to create economic security and reliability between clients and servers in a permissionless way. This peer-to-peer marketplace is dynamic; clients can select single- or multi-hop onion routed circuits by selecting nodes randomly weighted on stake and filtered on secondary desiderata (price, location, etc.). A single hop route has the benefits of a normal VPN connection, creating a tunnel to route your traffic over a public network or your ISP, while a multi-hop connection provides additional privacy benefits by securing your network data from any one provider.</p><p>Traditional VPNs today are limited; the centralized nature of their offering cannot compete with the distributed properties of combining multiple different providers to offer multi-hop level security. And even if a single company offers multiple hop VPN routes, there is still a single centralized entity you are placing your trust into. Using a distributed system allows you, as a user, to distribute trust across multiple distinct VPN providers, thereby breaking apart the flow of your information so no single entity can see the entire picture.

<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>Service providers on Orchid are anticipated to run a server similar to a typical VPN daemon for protocols such as OpenVPN, but which speaks the Orchid protocol. Orchid servers maintain registration information in a stake registry and provider directory. The stake registry is optimized to enable the Orchid client to automatically discover random servers on behalf of users in a decentralized environment, while the provider directory allows server nodes to register metadata such as geolocation or additional services offered. Collectively, the Orchid Servers make up the Network.</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><h2 id="theorchidnetworkdesign">The Orchid Network Design</h2>

</ul>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>Bandwidth sellers register their nodes on the Ethereum blockchain and user clients select suitable nodes for routes through calls to Ethereum smart contracts.

<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>The various components described above collectively form Orchid. When we put the pieces together, we are in the process of creating a new VPN product that harnesses the nature of decentralization to distribute trust across multiple providers and ultimately give the user far more agency and control than is available on the current market. By combining a decentralized design with a market-based incentive structure, we believe that users can protect their privacy and control their data while creating demand to support a healthy marketplace.</p><p>We anticipate in the future that the open source community developing on our protocol will be working on solutions for traffic analysis resistance, payment anonymity, low-variance nanopayments, improved double-spend detection and prevention, traffic obfuscation, improved censorship resistance, whitelist surety bonds, and more.</p><p>As both governments and corporations attempt to control our online interactions, the VPN market is skyrocketing. But in order to achieve what users desire in a VPN service, we need a new model. At Orchid, we think that a peer-to-peer marketplace and decentralized architecture on the Ethereum blockchain can help pave the way for a new era of online interaction, where individuals, not organizations, control the future.</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><h2 id="stayuptodatewithorchid">Stay Up to date with Orchid</h2>

Or do you just flick on the light so you don’t bump your head?</p><p>And if you could pay for other kinds of services the same way you pay for electricity — a tiny flow of resources that could be turned on or off at any moment — what possibilities would that open up?</p><p>Orchid’s novel layer 2 scaling architecture for Ethereum uses probabilistic nanopayments to allow users to pay for services in just this way. Nanopayments are what they sound like: they are tiny, and you can turn them on or off at will. But unlike a monthly electric bill, nanopayments transmit value as they move. We’re using this core technology to power our bandwidth marketplace, which is intended to offer users of the Orchid App a new way to construct VPN routes and manage them — just like flicking on a light switch.</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><h2 id="scalingpaymentsonethereumwithorchid">Scaling payments on Ethereum with Orchid</h2>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>The Orchid Network’s bandwidth marketplace is two-sided, comprising buyers (Orchid App users) and sellers (Orchid Server operators). The exchange of bandwidth requires a high transaction throughput to support both basic service and payments. Payments are expected to be made at a per-packet level with high frequency. Ethereum’s layer 1 would be too slow and expensive to settle nano transactions at the level of bandwidth exchange required between buyers and sellers in the ecosystem. To solve this issue, Orchid uses an advanced payments architecture known as probabilistic nanopayments for per-packet network payments.</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><h2 id="existinglayer2scalingsolutions">Existing layer 2 scaling solutions</h2>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>Several layer 2 scaling proposals already exist, including the <a href="https://lightning.network/" rel="noopener nofollow">Lightning Network</a> on Bitcoin and the <a href="https://raiden.network/" rel="noopener nofollow">Raiden Network</a> on Ethereum. Both of these approaches fall into the category of networked payment channels, which could, in theory, serve as the payments layer for Orchid’s bandwidth marketplace.</p><p>However, networked payment channels have several key disadvantages. They require users to deposit and lockup funds with specific network nodes, creating counterparty risk. The cost of a payment using networked payment channels is essentially O(log N), compared with O(C) for probabilistic payments, making them less scaling efficient. Network channel payments can also fail to route or fail to deliver in a timely manner if a single node in the circuit fails. Finally, they leak payment information to more parties than stochastic payments. For these reasons, network payment channels are less practical than nanopayments for Orchid’s use case.</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><h2 id="orchidnanopaymentshowtheywork">Orchid Nanopayments: how they work</h2>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>Instead of sending a transaction worth $1 directly, with probabilistic payments the buyer could send a 1% chance of winning $100. Orchid’s design takes this to an extreme, with nanopayment tickets representing the value of thousandths of a penny, or smaller. The tickets are all sent off-chain; only when a winning ticket is redeemed would its receiver have to make an on-chain transaction to claim the face value amount, which is rare. The receiver has no way to know if a ticket is a winner beforehand, therefore giving all tickets implied value.</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><h2 id="theexpectedflowofnanopayments">The expected flow of nanopayments</h2>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><ul>
<li>Sender opens nanopayment account by depositing OXT into an Ethereum smart contract.</li>
<li>Sender can then issue valid nanopayments, backed by the deposit, to any provider on the network that is accepting payments for service.</li>
<li>Eventually, the user is expected to issue a nanopayment that “wins”, which allows the provider to redeem the ticket as a payment via an on-chain transaction.</li>
<li>The user may or may not need to add more OXT to their nanopayment account, depending on the level of funds in the account.</li>
<li>Over time, the value transmitted on-chain will in expectation match the value represented in the probabilistic nanopayments.</li>
</ul>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><!--kg-card-begin: image--><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://orchid-ghost-admin.circleclick.com/content/images/2019/11/image-5.png" class="kg-image" alt="Introducing Nanopayments"/></figure><!--kg-card-end: image--><p>The graphic above demonstrates how the Orchid App users are expected to be able to send nanopayments to multiple providers after incurring a single deposit setup on the Ethereum blockchain, as well as how the general flow of payments is intended to operate.</p><p>We believe the general properties of this system are well suited for a bandwidth marketplace, where the user requires the ability to select different providers at will and for them to very quickly establish a payment-for-services relationship. Users should be able to quickly change VPN providers arbitrarily based on speed, availability, price and/or location. The setup of the nanopayment account on Ethereum is structured to be shouldered by the user, but is compatible with the current VPN market where users sign monthly, annual, or even multi-annual agreements with providers for VPN service. The Orchid user is expected to have the added benefit of being able to take back the deposit from the nanopayment account if they stop using the service.</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><h2 id="balancevariance">Balance Variance</h2>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>Orchid nanopayments do have one notable limitation: variance. Each time the Orchid App issues a nanopayment, there is a small independent probability of a winning ticket, which would decrease the receiver’s account balance. If the client’s balance was only large enough to cover a single winner, this would be a serious limitation. To illustrate this, imagine a client issuing tickets that have a 1-in-a-million chance of $2 at a rate of 1 million per week. While on average there will only be 1 winner per week, there is a reasonable probability that the winning ticket will be issued on the first day or even in the first few hours. On the plus side, there’s also a reasonable chance the winner won’t pop up for a few weeks. Fortunately we believe there’s a fairly simple solution: clients can just deposit a multiple of the face value, thereby smoothing out the variance. If we model this as a binomial distribution and if the client has $20 in their account instead of $2, the chance of their balance being depleted twice as fast as expected is reduced from around 10% to about 2%.</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><h2 id="paymentanonymity">Payment Anonymity</h2>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>Most nanopayment tickets do not “win,” and therefore would not be posted on-chain. However, rare winning tickets result in a public record on the Ethereum blockchain. Therefore, Orchid nanopayments are only pseudo-anonymous. For multi-hop circuits, it is anticipated that the Orchid client uses a separate account for each hop, which helps prevent anyone tracing the circuit using public payment information. As winning tickets are rare — anticipated to be approximately once per week in common circumstances — the public payment record from a multi-hop circuit is designed to appear essentially indistinguishable from that of a single-hop circuit. We expect that an adversary trying to trace the route will learn some of the payment providers associated with a payer’s public address, but the probability of two or more winning tickets to different nodes in the same circuit at the same time is vanishingly small, which reduces the traceability of transactions.</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><h2 id="censorshipresistance">Censorship resistance</h2>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>As on most public blockchain networks, Ethereum transactions cannot be censored unless their validators (miners in the Ethereum network) choose not to include them in their created blocks. As blocks are mined randomly among all miners in proportion to hash power, the vast majority of miners would have to actively censor Orchid payments to significantly disrupt the Orchid Network. For example, if 90% of the hash power chose not to include Orchid-related transactions, the Orchid Network would still function, albeit with transactions taking, on average, ten times longer to confirm.</p><p>A more severe form of censorship would be possible if a large group of miners — say 51% — chose to censor Orchid-related transactions by rejecting blocks that included them. This would be valid according to the rules of the Ethereum protocol, and would effectively create a soft fork. However, organizing large-scale miner collusion to create such a soft fork carries significant risk of financial loss for the colluders; if the soft fork fails to achieve sufficient hashing power, the colluding miners would miss out on their block rewards. Even without the risk of financial loss, we consider this possibility extremely unlikely due to the decentralized nature of Ethereum mining communities and the lack of legal and regulatory limitations on blockchain mining strategies.</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>We believe that Orchid nanopayments have advantages over existing payment channel solutions and are optimized to provide a continuous service to users. The reduction in transaction fees makes it possible to support up to millions of users, without requiring any upgrades to Ethereum itself. Setup costs are not pairwise, but are only incurred by the user to start. This means providers are expected to be able to immediately begin servicing users without incurring setup costs and users are expected to have the ability to switch between providers on a whim, which we view as a design requirement for a modern-day VPN application.</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><h2 id="stayuptodatewithorchid">Stay Up to date with Orchid</h2>

<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>In their most basic sense, VPNs are intended to allow people to access the internet without fear of tracking, censorship, or having their personal information compromised. Because of this, we’re seeing a massive rise in their use.</p><p>Approximately 25% of internet users in the world now use a VPN each month. And that rise in users has led to a massive market to capitalize on user demand. Industry reports show that the VPN market is growing by billions of dollars each year, and is projected to more than triple, from $15.46 billion in 2016 to $54 billion by 2024.</p><p>Young people are a large reason for this projected increase; 68% of VPN users are under the age of 35. The reasons they’re using these services are relatable to anyone who has the internet. The primary reason people use a VPN is to access entertainment content; the secondary, to gain access to social networks and news.</p><p>At its core, this increased usage should be a good thing. People around the world are finding ways to circumvent the restrictive, exploitative nature of the current internet. But the reliance on VPNs to help make a better internet relies on one basic premise: complete trust in the company behind the VPN.</p><p>As the market for VPN services grows, consumers are presented with increasing options. We have to ask ourselves: Do each of these services really offer us the security and privacy that a VPN is meant to deliver? Sadly, the answer is no.</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><h2 id="whycurrentvpnscantsolveourbiggestchallenges">Why Current VPNs Can’t Solve Our Biggest Challenges</h2>

Centralized VPNs are susceptible to firewall blockages and often rely on remaining compliant with governments in order to operate. By their very nature, they can’t provide the user with the benefits desired.</p><p>For VPN users in nations with regimes attempting to control the flow of news and information, governments heavily regulate the VPN industry. Operating within many nations means that a VPN provider has to register or get licensed with the government. How is it possible to trust a VPN approved by a government attempting to control and monitor online traffic? For instance, roughly 60% of the top, free VPN services are based in China. Do we have faith that the Chinese government is allowing the services to operate without monitoring user behavior?</p><p>In nations where the population enjoys unfettered access to news and information, another threat arises — a lack of transparency on the part of VPN providers. In a study of the world’s 115 most popular VPNs, 26 were found to be keeping tabs on their users. While marketing language may argue otherwise, the business model for many free VPNs is based on the provider harvesting and selling the users’ personal data. Buried in that fine print at the bottom of the terms and conditions is the acquiescence of consent.</p><!--kg-card-begin: image--><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://orchid-ghost-admin.circleclick.com/content/images/2019/10/0_DOEy9TgdGBuFcLqq.png" class="kg-image" alt="Why We Need a Better VPN"/></figure><!--kg-card-end: image--><p>Sold as a way to ensure private, secure browsing, the companies behind VPNs are actually tracking user data related to bandwidth, connection timestamps, IP addresses, and websites visited. Users who rely on services like this are often unaware they are being monitored and tracked. We’re left asking: To whom is the data sold to and for what purpose?</p><p>In other words, while internet users are attempting to gain access free of censorship and personal data mining, the services they use to do that are compounding the issue by exploiting their trust. At the heart of this problem is the issue of centralization. A centralized system requires complete trust on the part of the user, and with complete trust comes the ability to exploit it.</p><p>Security and protection pose additional threats. The vast majority of VPNs rely on single-hop service, which allows interested parties to discover both where traffic is coming from and where it is going. Traditional VPN traffic also leaves a signature that is relatively easy to spot. For users in countries where attempting to access a news website, like the BBC, or a social network, like Facebook, presents the threat of imprisonment, this is a very real danger.</p><p>While there have been genuine attempts to alleviate the above issues via the use of decentralized VPNs, the attempts thus far have fallen short. VPNs featuring the use of decentralized servers have relied on a system of volunteers to act as nodes to power the system. While these services have gained some traction, the lack of volunteers has led to systems that lack the bandwidth, computational capacity, and servers to create a truly secure, private online experience.</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><h2 id="buildingabettervpn">Building a Better VPN</h2>

<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>Orchid Labs’ mission is to build open source software that keeps the Internet open and accessible — a natural resource for everyone, everywhere.</p><p>Our first step to fulfill that mission is to create a protocol that governs a decentralized marketplace with a commodity specification for bandwidth. One key element of the marketplace is a second layer payment solution, “Probabilistic Micropayments”, which adds transaction throughput and privacy to Ethereum. Another is a Medallion system for bandwidth providers that grants the network Sybil resistance and hardens it to other classes of attacks. More detail is laid out in our <a href="https://www.orchid.com/assets/whitepaper/whitepaper.pdf" rel="noopener">whitepaper</a>.</p><p>The first application that buys bandwidth on our marketplace will be the Orchid App (coming soon to iOS and Android!). The Orchid App is an open source VPN client with added security features, such as multi-hop routing. The goal with the software is to provide secure access to the open Internet, right in line with our mission. We also hope to play a part in driving the VPN market towards more transparency, privacy and fairer pricing.</p><p>Other applications can be built that harness the power of our protocol and bandwidth marketplace. The Orchid App will serve as a first example and we are excited to discuss potential integrations. Email our team at <a href="mailto:%22partners@orchid.com%22" rel="noopener">partners@orchid.com</a> to talk to us.</p><p>As we have been building over the past year, we continue to see concerning developments across the globe as the Internet splinters and new forms of communication control are put into place. We believe that our contribution can help the world become openly connected.</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><h2 id="progressin2019">Progress in 2019</h2>

At <a href="http://www.orchidprotocol.com/" rel="noopener">Orchid Labs</a>, our goal is to ensure that every person on Earth can have access to an open, decentralized, and uncensored Internet. We believe a better Internet is one that isn’t controlled by the few, but open to all.</p><p>Currently, Internet access for the majority of the people on Earth is censored and monitored. Because of this, many Internet users are blocked from freely communicating, collaborating, and accessing information. The current centralized system, which limits our ability to communicate and learn — while also harvesting and selling our personal data — is far from the full potential of what the internet could be and strays from the original intention of its creators.</p><p>That’s why we’ve launched the Orchid Protocol, an open-source overlay network that uses excess bandwidth on top of the existing Internet to ensure that people — no matter where they live on our planet — can have unrestricted access to information and collaboration. Orchid’s protocol combines surplus bandwidth, state-of-the-art encryption, and a decentralized infrastructure enabling any Internet user to participate and exchange bandwidth for payment in peer-to-peer transactions using Orchid tokens on the Ethereum blockchain.</p><p>Our team consists of engineers, cryptocurrency experts, technologists, and partners dedicated to creating an Internet free of surveillance and censorship. This idea isn’t new; there are people across the globe dedicated to this cause. We believe the Orchid Protocol will help the world finally create this reality.</p><p>While I’ve been interested in the idea of Internet freedom for some time, the origins of Orchid stem from conversations with Steve Bell, an entrepreneur with more than a decade of experience backing Chinese seed stage startups. We had both personally experienced and witnessed the consequences of surveillance and censorship in our work across the world. My concern was one of surveillance, while Steve’s was one of censorship or access. My perspective was, “how do communicate or access information in a potentially totalitarian state in a private fashion”. I had also experience security issues first hand, both during the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/01/05/bitstamp-bitcoin-exchange-hack/" rel="noopener">Bitstamp hack of 2015</a> and in having my own phone <a href="https://medium.com/@stevewaterhouse/notes-on-recovering-from-a-hack-3cd438e10fe0" rel="noopener">ported</a>.</p><p>We started discussing ways to create an internet free of surveillance and censorship that everyone in the world could access. With a passion for where we wanted to go and a firm idea of how to get there, we knew we needed the technological expertise and funding to make this happen.</p><p>Fortunately, we’ve met many technologists and partners who are also passionate about this cause, and who believe in Orchid’s ability to transform the way that users can utilize and access the Internet.</p><p>Olaf Carlson-Wee from <a href="http://polychain.capital/" rel="noopener">Polychain Capita</a>l is an investor who focuses on emerging Internet-based technologies. “We’ve invested in a number of projects that I would say focus on preserving privacy on the Internet and enabling people to use the Internet in a more free and open way,” he said. “I’d say that cryptocurrency largely falls into this category as well. We invested in Orchid because we think it’s the most sophisticated project we’ve seen to date that’s trying to solve problems within this space.”</p><p>Steve Bell had worked with open-source advocate and technologist Brian J. Fox in more than one venture. Steve and Brian had been talking years earlier about the different ways in which restrictive firewalls could be bypassed, enabling freedom of speech on the Internet. When the three of us met to discuss the Orchid mission, it became clear that we had the makings of the core team well underway. Brian had known the software engineer and developer of Cydia, Jay Freeman, for years, and Jay helped us take our project from concept to development stage.</p><p>For an expert in creating the technology for an alternative funding model, we turned to Gustav Simonsson, an engineer and developer who helped launch Ethereum. Together, this team brings an immense amount of passion, experience, and expertise that can make the goal of an uncensored, surveillance-free Internet a reality. We believe that together, we’ve created a protocol that will transform the current power structure of the Internet and benefit every Internet user in the world.</p><p>One of our first investors, W. Bradford Stephens of <a href="http://blockchain.capital/" rel="noopener">Blockchain Capital</a>, has known and worked with me for years. “We support blockchain enabled technologies and when you have an idea that can impact and empower billions of people by creating a more open and inclusive Internet — with the right technology and team — we realized the benefit could affect everyone, no matter where you are on the planet.”</p><p><a href="https://dfj.com/" rel="noopener">DFJ Venture Capital</a>, another of our partners, believes, “Mission- and purpose-driven businesses last longer. Like open-source communities working on a common goal. These galvanizing rods let people do amazing work. You want your employees and customers to be rooting for you. You can make money anywhere, whereas changing the world, it transcends your existence, and money never does that.”</p><p>The Internet is the most powerful tool for gathering information and collaborating that’s ever existed. At Orchid Labs, we believe in order for its fullest potential to be reached, this tool needs to be available for everyone, free of censorship and surveillance, and it needs to protect each user’s personal data.</p><p>Because of the passion and expertise of our team, and investors who believe in this mission and our ability to actuate it, we have the technology, drive, and resources to make this dream a reality. If you believe in these same ideals, and an approach that combines open-source technology backed by cryptocurrency, we hope that you’ll join us in our mission to realize a better Internet.</p><p>Web: <a href="https://orchidprotcol.com/" rel="noopener">Orchid Protocol</a></p><p>Twitter: <a href="https://twitter.com/orchidprotocol" rel="noopener">@orchidprotocol</a></p>]]></content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
